# Wildlife Tracker - [wildlife-tracker.com](https://wildlife-tracker.com)
A full-stack web application that takes location data from [movebank.org](movebank.org) and plots it on a base map (Mapbox or Google) using [deck.gl](deck.gl) for 3d data visualization. MoveBank is an online platform used by researchers and wildlife managers to archive, manage, and analyze animal tracking data. The purpose of my site is to provide an interface for searching specific studies and to add some cool visualizations of the tracking data. If the idea intrigues you, consider supporting the official [Animal Tracker app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-tracker/id813629500). 

Please feel free to message me if you have any questions or concerns.

# Demonstration

# Features in the works
- allow users to log in and save settings
- more ways to search for studies (by date, author, etc)
- more control panel options to change how the data is visualized
- updates to the UI
- add animations using the [trips deck.gl layer](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/geo-layers/trips-layer) along with an appropriate interface
  
I'm the only maintainer, so this may take a while.

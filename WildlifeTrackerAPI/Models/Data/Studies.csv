The main objective is to known long-term changes in the dispersal movements and migration patterns of young vultures during the preadult stage with special attention to the effects of environmental and individual constraints.  Apart of this, we are interested in the knowledge of survival rates of non-adult birds as previous studies demonstrated a high mortality of GPS-tagged adults in the same study population.  All together, the results will help to determine accurately the viability of griffon vulture populations in anthropized environments

"<b>1990s field study</b>: Our satellite telemetry projects could not have been conducted without the training by CE Korschgen and KP Kenow, National Biological Biological Service (NBS; now US Geological Survey, USGS) in the surgical procedure and invaluable assistance with their implant technique. Paul W and Christiane Howey, Microwave Telemetry, Inc. made these projects possible with the development of small,implantable satellite transmitters and their willingness to modify transmitters in response to the needs of the projects. We thank R West, R Leedy and A Rappoport, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and DV Derksen, USGS for their constant support and encouragement of satellite telemetry projects. D. Troy, PL Flint, JB Grand, JM Schmutz, JM Pearce and A Degteyerev allowed us to mark birds on their study areas; they and their crews were instrumental in capturing birds. Veterinarians DM Mulcahy, A Parks, K Burek, P Tuomi and T O’Hare implanted satellite transmitters.</br></br><b>2000s field study</b>: We thank D.

The species’ colonies in Iceland lie between the
European and North American colonies. To better understand
their migratory patterns and to explore potential
connections between the western and eastern populations,
geo-location devices were used to track the migrations of
Northern Gannets from Iceland. Findings support ringing
records in demonstrating a primarily south-eastward movement
following the breeding season, with no tracked birds wintering in western Atlantic waters. Fifteen successfully
tracked adult birds wintered over a range of about 5000 km
on continental shelf seas from NW Scotland to NW Africa
with areas of concentration off Africa and in the Celtic Sea.
Direct distance from the colony to the most distant point
reached ranged from 1200 to 6100 km. Trips amounted to
16,100–33,500 km over the entire migration/winter period.
While birds heading for NW Africa mostly showed a relatively
straight migration direction, several round trips were
recorded in (N)W Europe. Migration trips and over-winter
colony absence lasted between 126 and 189 days. Birds
departed from the colony from 9 to 24 September and
returned from 19 January to 27 March. Timing and duration
of migration and wintering periods varied substantially
among individuals. Gannets staying in the waters of NW
Africa experienced much higher sea surface temperatures
than birds wintering further north, suggesting higher thermostatic
costs for the latter.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2010-09-09 11:59:00.000,2011-03-27 23:59:00.000,5006,Morus bassanus,Solar Geolocator,stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)

were studied over 2 consecutive winters by deploying geolocation data loggers on breeding
adults from the Bass Rock, UK. Northern gannets attended the breeding colony on Bass Rock until
between 24 September and 16 October (median: 5 October). Afterwards, individual birds engaged in
different migratory behaviour. Of the 22 birds tracked until at least December, 18% wintered in the
North Sea and the English Channel, 27% in the Bay of Biscay and the Celtic Sea, 9% in the Mediterranean
Sea and 45% off West Africa. Individual winter home ranges as measured by the 75% kernel
density contours varied between 8100 and 308 500 km2 (mean = 134 000 km2). Several northern gannets
migrated northwards from Bass Rock after leaving the colony for a stay of a few days to a few
weeks, independent of whether they migrated to Africa or other southern areas later. Birds wintering
off West Africa migrated to their wintering areas mostly within 3 to 5 wk, usually starting between
early and late October. Most of these birds stayed off West Africa for a period of about 3 mo, where
they remained in a relatively restricted area. Return migration was initiated between the end of January
and mid-February, and took about as long as autumn migration. We conclude that individual
gannets display very variable migratory behaviours, with discrete winter home ranges, and we infer
that the migration habits of gannets may be changing in response to human impacts on marine
ecosystems.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2002-09-24 11:59:00.000,2004-03-15 23:59:00.000,4677,Morus bassanus,Solar Geolocator,stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)

Ultimately, this information will be used as part of the effort to estimate population growth rate and factors limiting growth of the KIMU population in Icy Bay.
Research Objectives
1. Estimate current breeding distribution and population size of peregrine falcons in the Icy Bay area and compare that to previous surveys, where available.
2. Describe the effect of predation by peregrine falcons on Kittlitz's Murrelets by quantifying the incidence of Kittlitz's Murrelets in raptor diets.

We used state‐of‐art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines.

Sex and age bias in turbine collisions can exacerbate these impacts through demographic changes that can lead to population decline or collapse. While several studies have reported sex and age differences in the number of soaring birds killed by turbines, it remains unclear if they result from different abundances or group-specific turbine avoidance behaviours, the latter having severer consequences. We investigated sex and age effects on turbine avoidance behaviour of black kites (Milvus migrans) during migration near the Strait of Gibraltar. We tracked the movements of 135 individuals with GPS data loggers in an area with high density of turbines and then modelled the effect of proximity of turbines on bird utilization distribution (UD). Both sexes and age classes showed similar patterns of displacement, with reduced UD values in the proximity of turbines and a clear peak at 700–850 m away, probably marking the distance at which most birds turn direction to avoid approaching the turbines further. The consistency of these patterns indicates that displacement range can be used as an accurate proxy for collision risk and habitat loss, and should be incorporated in environmental impact assessment studies.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2012-08-09 12:10:24.000,2013-09-11 09:06:15.000,231193,Milvus migrans,GPS,cdsantos

Here we provide information collected from 1993–2005 on what we believe is a recently established and expanding population of High Arctic nesting Peregrines in the area associated with climate change. From 1979 to 2005, the average of the mean monthly temperature, minimum monthly temperature, and maximum monthly temperature for the five-month period, May through September, increased 1.1, 0.5, and 1.6 °C, respectively. Forty-one breeding attempts were recorded at six sites from 1993 to 2005 for this new population. Satellite transmitters were used to determine the home ranges and seasonal movements of female Peregrines, with adults traveling an average of 10,794 km at a rate of 205 km/day on outward migration. During outward migration, the maximum distance traveled by any female on one day was 1,349 km with the maximum total outward and return migrations for single individuals 12,438 and 11,071 km, respectively, to and from south America. Comparisons with Peregrine populations in Greenland at 67° N and 60.5° N, approximately 1,100 (Kangerlussuaq) and 1,700 (south Greenland) km south of the Pituffik area, respectively, show differences in various aspects of ecology. Based on a lack of both morphological and genetic differences it appears the Pituffik area population is likely a result of the extension of more southern breeding Peregrines moving north and taking advantage of an ameliorating climate and lengthened breeding window. Should climatic amelioration continue, the species may eventually expand its range into the very northernmost land area, Peary Land.

This precludes researchers from identifying demographically discrete units for population management and understanding the scale of inference from field studies. Further, habitats and specific sites that may be particularly important for BAGO are difficult to identify, as this species is not well covered by surveys for most of its annual cycle and range. Our research addresses the following questions: 1) What are the rates, and geographic scale, of inter-annual site fidelity by all sex and age classes at various stages of the annual cycle? 2) Do birds from the same breeding site occur in discrete areas during winter, or are they widely distributed, and vice versa? 3) How do the answers to 1 and 2 above combine to indicate demographically distinct management units? 4) Are there important habitats or specific sites that are used by a large proportion of marked birds, which would indicate their value for conservation? From 2006 to 2012, we deployed 267 satellite transmitters (PTTs) on BAGO at five sites in British Columbia, Alberta, and Alaska.

Together with our collaborators at NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Point Adams Field Station (Dr. Jen Zamon), University of Washington (Elizabeth Phillips), and Oregon State University (Stephanie Loredo) we conducted night-time captures at sea using an inflatable skiff, spotlight, and dip-net. We transported captured murres to our mother vessel, the M/V Forerunner operated by the Clatsop Community College, Marine and Environmental Research and Training Station (MERTS) for satellite transmitter attachments and subsequent release approximately 3 miles off the Columbia River mouth. Foraging aggregations of murres are commonly observed near the mouth of the Columbia River. Densities here can often exceed 50 birds per square km, making them the one of the most conspicuous and abundant piscivourous seabird predators in the region. Aggregations often are observed feeding at the turbulent boundary between fresh river water and salty ocean water (the “plume front”). Young salmon migrating out of the Columbia River must successfully pass through this boundary to begin their ocean phase of life. To develop an understanding of how murres and young salmon interact in the plume environment, this project used satellite tags and ship-and aircraft-based ocean surveys to gather information about Common Murre habitat use, diet, movements and residency time in the Columbia River region.

During migration, rufa Red Knots rest and refuel at stopover sites along the Atlantic Coast of the USA, including Kiawah and Seabrook islands in South Carolina. We document the importance of Kiawah and Seabrook islands forknots during their spring migration using on-the-ground surveys between 19 February and 20 May 2021 to record the occurrence and proportion of individually marked knots, as well as geolocators deployed on knots captured in the area. Using a superpopulation model, we estimated a minimum passage population of 17,247 knots (95% CI: 13,548–22,099; ~41% of the total rufa knot population) and an average stopover duration of 47 days (95% CI: 40.1–54.8). Our geolocator results showed that knots using Kiawah and Seabrook islands can bypass Delaware Bay and fly directly to the Canadian Arctic. Finally, our geolocators, combined with resighting data from across the Atlantic Flyway, indicate that a large network of more than 70 coastal sites concentrated largely in the southeastern USA provide stopover and overwintering habitat for the knots we observed on Kiawah and Seabrook islands. These findings show that Kiawah and Seabrook islands should be recognized as critical sites in the knot network and, therefore, a conservation priority. The threats facing these sites, such as prey depletion, anthropogenic disturbance, and sea level rise, require immediate attention.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,,,,Calidris canutus,Solar Geolocator Raw,HUGOMigrate (Nathan Senner)

Animals must balance seasonal and daily changes to landscape risk with the underlying resources provided by that landscape. One way to balance the seasonal and daily changes in the costs and benefits of a landscape is through behaviorally-explicit resource selection and temporal partitioning. Here, we test whether resource selection of coyotes (Canis latrans) in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada is behaviorally-explicit and responsive to the daily and seasonal variation to presumed costs and benefits of moving on the landscape. We used GPS data and local convex hulls to estimate space use and Hidden Markov Models to estimate three types of movement behavior: encamped, foraging, and traveling. We then used integrated step-selection analysis to investigate behaviorally explicit resource selection across times of day (diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal) and season (snow-free and snow). We found that throughout the day and seasonally coyotes shifted foraging behavior and altered behavior and resource choices to avoid moving across what we could be a challenging landscape. These changes in behavior suggest that coyotes have a complex response to land cover, terrain, and linear corridors that are not only scale dependent but also vary by behavior, diel period, and season. By examining the resource selection across three axes (behavior, time of day, and season), we have a more nuanced understanding of how a predator balances the cost and benefits of a stochastic environment.",research,true,true,false,false,False,na,,,,,GPS,e.hance (Hance Ellington)

We assessed the importance of different landscape elements (open sea, tidal flats and inland) by comparing marine and terrestrial foraging behaviours in lesser black-backed gulls breeding along the coast of the southern North Sea. We attached GPS data loggers to eight incubating birds and collected information on diet and habitat use. The loggers recorded data for 10–19 days to allow flight-path reconstruction. Lesser black-backed gulls foraged in both offshore and inland areas, but rarely on tidal flats. Targets and directions were similar among all eight individuals. Foraging trips (n = 108) lasted 0.5–26.4 h (mean 8.7 h), and ranges varied from 3.0–79.9 km (mean 30.9 km). The total distance travelled per foraging trip ranged from 7.5–333.6 km (mean 97.9 km). Trips out to sea were significantly more variable in all parameters than inland trips. Presence in inland areas was closely associated with daylight, whereas trips to sea occurred at day and night, but mostly at night. The most common items in pellets were grass (48%), insects (38%), fish (28%), litter (26%) and earthworms (20%). There was a significant relationship between the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals in blood and the proportional time each individual spent foraging at sea/land. On land, gulls preferentially foraged on bare ground, with significantly higher use of potato fields and significantly less use of grassland.

areas, is widespread in nature, and likely benefits individuals through higher foraging
efficiency and potentially, higher breeding success. It may arise as a consequence of
habitat or resource specialisation, or alternatively, where resources are abundant or
predictable, the partitioning of space might guarantee individuals exclusive foraging
opportunities. We tracked seven adult great black-backed gulls Larus marinus at a
North Sea colony from early incubation to the end of the breeding season in 2016,
providing a total of 1170 foraging trips over a mean ± SD tracking period of 67 ± 16
days. There was clear spatial segregation between individuals, with almost no overlap
of their core areas (50% utilisation distribution) during incubation and chickrearing.
Core areas were relatively small and there was high repeatability (R ± SE) in
foraging parameters, including initial departure direction (0.73 ± 0.11), foraging range
(0.41 ± 0.14) and cumulative distance travelled (0.19 ± 0.1) throughout the breeding
season. Despite the low spatial overlap, there was little evidence of differential habitat
use by individuals. The near-exclusive individual foraging areas of this species, usually
considered to be a generalist, indicate that where there is high resource availability
throughout the breeding season and a small local population, individuals appear to
adopt a territorial strategy which likely reduces intraspecific competition.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2016-05-01 00:03:32.000,2016-07-15 23:59:45.000,275521,Larus marinus,GPS,stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)

Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many species are extremely difficult to detect outside of breeding. Here, we demonstrate a partial solution to this problem by using archival GPS tags to examine the overwintering ecology of a migratory nocturnal bird, the eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferous). We deployed tags on 21 individuals and were able to recover 11 (52%) one year later. Tags collected high precision (approx. 10m) points throughout the nonbreeding period. With continuous time movement models, we used these data to estimate overwintering home ranges. All individuals exhibited at least one bounded home range during this phase of the annual cycle, three of eleven had two wintering locations, and home range area ranged from 0.50–10.85ha. All overwintering home ranges contained closed-canopy forest land cover (42-100%), and no other land cover type represented >40% of any home range.  We found some evidence, with caveats, that total edge within the landscape surrounding the home range was negatively related to home range area. The prevalence of contiguous closed-canopy forest cover in overwintering home ranges contrasts with apparent breeding habitat preferences, which includes clear cuts and other, more open, habitats. This study is the first to reveal key aspects of overwintering space use in this species by using archival GPS to overcome both logistical and methodological limitations. Expanded use of such technology is critical to gathering basic ecological and distributional data, necessary for achieving a more complete understanding of full annual cycles of animal populations.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2017-10-02 02:54:00.000,2018-03-25 02:50:00.000,296,Antrostomus vociferus,GPS,chris_tonra (Christopher Tonra)

Aspects of spatial memory and perception likely combine to support the now well-documented ability of homing pigeons to learn to retrace the same route when homing from familiar locations, leading to the prediction that damage to the HF would result in a diminished ability to repeatedly fly a similar route home. HF-lesioned homing pigeons were repeatedly released from three sites to assess the importance of the hippocampus as pigeons gradually learn a familiar route home guided by familiar landmark and landscape features. As expected, control pigeons displayed increasing fidelity to a familiar route home, and by inference, successful perceptual and memory processing of familiar landmarks/landscape features. By contrast, the impoverished route fidelity of the HF-lesioned pigeons indicated an impaired sensitivity to the same landmark/landscape features.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2018-07-06 06:22:29.000,2018-07-31 13:38:23.000,1825482,Columba livia,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

Ranging behaviour has been widely studied in Eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and Western (Pan troglodytes verus) chimpanzees. However, relatively little is known about home ranges in central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). Here, we present the first insight into the home range of a central chimpanzee community living in a habitat mosaic in the Loango National Park (Gabon) after the habituation. Data on traveling routes were collected during party follows between January 2017 and April 2019 (N=724.286 relocations, collected over 664 days and 6.153 hours of observation). To calculate the home range, we used three: Minimum Convex Polygon, Kernel Density Estimation, and Biased Random Bridges. We compared our estimates to those minimum home range estimates from prior studies on Rekambo community and contrasted our estimates with those of other chimpanzee communities. The results showed that the home range size of the Rekambo community ranged between 28.65 - 59.04 km2 depending on the estimator and isopleth considered. The location of the home range remained reasonably stable during the last decade, while the overall size decreased. The Rekambo home range is therefore among one of the largest so far documented for forest-living chimpanzees.

This precludes researchers from identifying demographically discrete units for population management and understanding the scale of inference from field studies. Further, habitats and specific sites that may be particularly important for BAGO are difficult to identify, as this species is not well covered by surveys for most of its annual cycle and range.

Our research addresses the following questions:

1) What are the rates, and geographic scale, of inter-annual site fidelity by all sex and age classes at various stages of the annual cycle? 

2) Do birds from the same breeding site occur in discrete areas during winter, or     are they widely distributed, and vice versa?

4) Are there important habitats or specific sites that are used by a large proportion of marked birds, which would indicate their value for conservation?

The Canarian subspecies of Egyptian vulture (guirre, Neophron percnopterus majorensis) is currently constrained to the Eastern part of the archipelago with a total population in 2020 of 376 individuals and a total of 82 occupied breeding territories, of which 77 territories would be in Fuerteventura, 6 in Lanzarote, 1 in Alegranza and another one in Montaña Clara. The population has grown since 1998, going from 21 territories in 1998 to 82 in 2020. The island of Lanzarote continues to show a much lower growth rate than Fuerteventura. Although population increases an average of 5% per year, the Egyptian vulture remains a threatened species. Priority measures for the conservation of guirre in the Canary Islands should be aimed at reducing unnatural mortality, especially that derived from electrocutions in power lines, lead intoxication and deliberate poisonings. Collisions in wind farms have already become a cause of death that must be avoided. Finally, the incidence of human nuisance in breeding areas must be reduced and and it should progress in studying the causes of reproductive failure.

In 2017, LIFE16 NAT/IT/000659 LIFE Egyptian Vulture Project was started for the recovery of Egyptian vulture in Italy and the Canary Islands. In Italy, E-Distribuzione, the Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale (ISPRA), the Federazione Italiana Parchi e Reserve Naturali (FEDERPARCHI) that brings together all the parks and nature reserves of Italy, and the governments of the Puglia Region and Basilicata, participate as partners. In the Canary Islands, the project partners are the General Directorate for the Fight against Climate Change and the Environment of the Government of the Canary Islands, the public company GESPLAN and the electricity company E-DISTRIBUCIÓN.

The purpose of Action D.1 of the Life Project is to know the trends of the population and to evaluate the results of the actions implemented within the LIFE Project. They will also allow to detect any risk factors to be taken into account for immediate corrective or supplementary interventions for the planning of future measures. This action is carried out with the scientific support of the Estación Biológica de Doñana-CSIC.

Action D.1 includes bird monitoring with GPS/GSM tags. As in previous studies, GPS/GSM radio transmitters will help us to determine the use of space both by territorial individuals and birds in the pre-adult stage. The specific objectives focus on two non-independent lines: the study of the ecology movement in relation to the availability of resources and the identification of factors determining dispersive processes and territory recruitment. This information will be relevant for territorial planning and to increase the growth rate, especially on the island of Lanzarote.

We studied the annual migration schedules of European nightjar, a large nocturnal insectivore and compared it with two other larger migratory insectivores, common swift and common cuckoo. All species breed in North Europe and winter in sub-Saharan Africa, but estimating their spatiotemporal non-breeding distributions from observations is complicated by the occurrence of similar local African species. We used geolocators to track the annual migrations of nightjars and swifts and compared these with satellite tracking of cuckoo migration. Individuals of the three species migrated to wintering grounds centered in Central Africa, except some common swifts that remained in West Africa, crossing or circumventing the Sahara along different routes in spring and fall. Overall, all species showed similar regional and seasonal use of several stopover areas during migration. Among the three species, European nightjars and common cuckoos showed the most similar spatiotemporal migration patterns. The nightjars wintered in SW Central Africa and breeding and wintering made up by far the two longest stationary periods. Swifts were generally more mobile, and some individuals progressively visited areas further east in East Africa during winter and further west in West Africa on spring migration; this species also spent less time on stopovers, but more on wintering areas. Cuckoos were intermediate in their extent of movements. The speed of nightjar spring migration was equal to that of fall migration, in contrast to the two other species where spring return to breeding areas was faster. Ecological requirements are potentially useful for understanding spatiotemporal migration patterns and causes of declines in migratory species",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2010-07-17 23:00:00.000,2012-06-07 23:00:00.000,774,,Solar Geolocator,SigneAgermose (Signe Agermose Mathiasen Andersen)

Reasons for this are unknown but thought to relate to human interference (set nets) and habitat degradation and or shifts in prey species. Reversing this trend of declining numbers is hampered by a lack of information on foraging behaviour and preferred diet. 
The aim of this research is to describe the foraging behaviour and contemporary and historic diets of spotted shags.  These data will feed conservation policy focussing on marine protection for the species within the Auckland region into the future.
Specific aims of this research are:
1)	Identify foraging areas for spotted shags by GPS tracking and time depth recorder analysis of breeding adults within the Hauraki Gulf.
2)	Characterise the diet of this species through analysis of diet samples and through stable isotopes obtained through collection of feathers and blood.
The outcome of this research is to improve and optimise conservation efforts for spotted shags.

Human habitation can influence desert ecosystems directly through changes in land use and indirectly through the introduction of
alien species that compete with locally adapted fauna. Native species can respond to these processes by spatial or temporal avoidance. Ruppell’s fox is a desert-adapted species inhabiting
flat, rocky arid areas that feeds mainly on invertebrates and rodents. We used location data and step selection functions to study the space use of a population in southern Israel. We hypothesized that Ruppell’s fox movement would be influenced by topography due to
preference for creeks, where insects and rodents are available, and by human infrastructure as the presence of humans, vehicles and associated animals may induce a fear effect on native species. Ruppell’s fox habitat selection was seasonal. During the dry season, foxes showed preference for flatter areas and creek bottoms and avoided paved roads. During the rainy season, foxes avoided less- trafficked dirt roads. These patterns were likely a consequence of increased territoriality due to denning in the colder season and reduced availability of insects in the dry season. Avoidance of paved and dirt roads may be explained by fear of human presence and perception of risk due to the use of linear features by larger
carnivores, such as wolves and red foxes. Our results suggest that current protected, remote and uninhabited areas have an elevated value for the persistence of Ruppell’s fox populations. We recommend limitation of vehicle movement within current reserves and continued monitoring of population trends for this little studied carnivore.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,,,,Vulpes rueppellii,,adibarocas (Adi Barocas)

Worldwide, there is only one (!) Individuals left in the Middle East showing the species-specific migratory behavior.

For 10 years, the Waldrappteam and its partners particular aim is to preserve the NBI as a migratory species from extinction, by creating new Migration traditions with descendants of European Zoo-Populations. A first migratory colony could be established. The birds breed in Burghausen/Bavaria and winter in the WWF Oasi Laguna di Orbetello/Tuscany. 

In 2014 a project, co-financed by the European Commission (LIFE+), starts. It aims to establish three migratory NBI colonies in Europe, with breeding areas north of the Alps and a common migration tradition to a wintering area in the southern Tuscany/Italy. 

All birds are equipped with GPS tags. The major aim for tagging is to implement actions against illegal hunting in Italy, the major threat for the free-flying birds. Two birds are currently tagged with solar-tags provided by the MPIAB. Our aim for the near future is to publish the majority of track via Movebank. 

The migration corridor ranges from Bavaria to the southern Tuscany, directly across the Alps and the Apennine. Major movements of adult birds along the migration corridor occur during the migration periods, which last from April till May (spring) resp. from August till October (autumn).

University of Vienna
Austria",isabella.scheiber@univie.ac.at,,"The daily or seasonal release of hormones is essential for synchronising biochemical, physiological or behavioural processes. Different hormones interact with each other at various levels; therefore, examining only one hormone separately will lead to an incomplete picture. No single hormone has a one-to-one relationship with any particular behaviour, and neither is any behaviour regulated by only one hormone. One main goal here is to gain a more complete understanding of the relationships between three rhythmic hormones and their influence on daily and seasonal activity at the individual level. This is highly relevant as mistimed biological clocks or deviations of a body’s own rhythm may cause health problems. The Kongsfjorden barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) colony, one of the best studied bird colonies worldwide, will serve as a model system. These geese have been investigated comprehensively for decades, therefore 2/3 of them are individually ringed. In the summer, they breed in the High Arctic (Spitzbergen, Norway, 78°55’N, 12°15’E), overwinter in a well-defined area in Scotland, and their spring and fall migration routes are known. Furthermore, all necessary technology and laboratory analyses to be applied are at hand. 
	As the major product of avian clocks, melatonin controls the sleep-wake cycle and other daily activities (feeding, rest) along with seasonal activities (e.g. hibernation, moult, migration and reproduction). The release of melatonin is controlled by daily changes of light and darkness: light causes an inhibition, but darkness triggers secretion, resulting in increased levels. Finally, melatonin triggers the regulation of other rhythmic hormones, such as prolactin and corticosterone. Besides other functions, all three hormones are released during the stress response, an elemental physiological task. The relationship between melatonin and the light-dark cycle is clearly defined in temperate latitudes, but above the Arctic and below the Antarctic circle (66°N/S), where 24-hours of daylight prevail in the summer, but 24-hours of darkness in the winter, this relationship is less clear, but it is fascinating for studying the effects of time and rhythmical phenomena of life processes. Indeed, the results so far are ambivalent: in some species the rhythm of melatonin secretion and associated physiological and behavioral processes are lost whereas other species retain them. we have recently demonstrated the presence of an intact, but phase-shifted circadian pattern in corticosterone excretion in Arctic barnacle goslings, I will for the first time examine, how the three hormones behave under polar summer light conditions in individual geese, and if and how they are associated with activity. It is also new to continue data collection by tracking those geese throughout the year to assess seasonal adaptations and relationships of the three hormones and biologically relevant events, such as during migration when on the wintering grounds.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2020-06-23 15:59:43.000,2023-05-22 17:50:39.000,921287,Branta leucopsis,GPS,Nonnengans (Isabella Scheiber)

We studied the annual migration schedules of European nightjar, a large nocturnal insectivore and compared it with two other larger migratory insectivores, common swift and common cuckoo. All species breed in North Europe and winter in sub-Saharan Africa, but estimating their spatiotemporal non-breeding distributions from observations is complicated by the occurrence of similar local African species. We used geolocators to track the annual migrations of nightjars and swifts and compared these with satellite tracking of cuckoo migration. Individuals of the three species migrated to wintering grounds centered in Central Africa, except some common swifts that remained in West Africa, crossing or circumventing the Sahara along different routes in spring and fall. Overall, all species showed similar regional and seasonal use of several stopover areas during migration. Among the three species, European nightjars and common cuckoos showed the most similar spatiotemporal migration patterns. The nightjars wintered in SW Central Africa and breeding and wintering made up by far the two longest stationary periods. Swifts were generally more mobile, and some individuals progressively visited areas further east in East Africa during winter and further west in West Africa on spring migration; this species also spent less time on stopovers, but more on wintering areas. Cuckoos were intermediate in their extent of movements. The speed of nightjar spring migration was equal to that of fall migration, in contrast to the two other species where spring return to breeding areas was faster. Ecological requirements are potentially useful for understanding spatiotemporal migration patterns and causes of declines in migratory species",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2010-08-04 00:00:00.000,2020-05-18 00:00:00.000,84,,Solar Geolocator,Fuglerejsen.dk (Fuglerejsen.dk (University of Copenhagen))

Migration is a prominent aspect of the life history of many avian species, but the demographic consequences of variable migration strategies have only infrequently been investigated, and rarely when using modern technological and analytical methods for assessing survival, movement patterns, and long-term productivity in the context of life history theory. We monitored the fates of 50 satellite-implanted tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) over 4 years from five disparate breeding areas in Alaska, and used known-fate analyses to estimate monthly survival probability relative to migration distance, breeding area, migratory flyway, breeding status, and age. We specifically tested whether migratory birds face a trade-off, whereby long-distance migrants realize higher survival rates at the cost of lower productivity because of reduced time on breeding areas relative to birds that migrate shorter distances and spend more time on breeding areas.
<br> <br>
<u>Results</u>: 
Annual migration distances varied significantly among breeding areas (1020 to 12720 km), and were strongly negatively correlated with time spent on breeding areas (r = -0.986). Estimates of annual survival probability varied by wintering area (Pacific coast, Alaska Peninsula, and Eastern seaboard) and ranged from 0.79 (95%CI: 0.70–0.88) to 1.0, depending on criteria used to discern mortalities from radio failures. We did not find evidence for a linear relationship between migration distance and survival as swans from the breeding areas with the shortest and longest migration distances had the highest survival probabilities. Survival was lower in the first year post-marking than in subsequent years, but there was not support for seasonal differences in survival. Productivity varied among breeding populations and was generally inversely correlated to survival, but not migration distance or time spent on breeding areas.
<br> <br>
<u>Conclusions</u>: 

Tundra swans conformed to a major tenet of life history theory, as populations with the highest survival generally had the lowest productivity. The lack of a uniform relationship between time spent on breeding areas and productivity, or time spent on wintering areas and survival, indicates that factors other than temporal investment dictate demographic outcomes in this species. The tremendous diversity of migration strategies we identify in Alaskan tundra swans, without clear impacts on survival, underscores the ability of this species to adapt to different environments and climatic regimes.

However, few studies have tried to validate the significance of these three concepts simultaneously, and long-term, high-resolution tagging datasets recording individual movements across consecutive years are scarce. We used such a dataset to explore intraspecific and intra-individual variabilities in departure and arrival decisions from/to wintering grounds in relation to these three different concepts in bird migration.

Methods: We equipped 23 curlews (Numenius arquata) wintering in the Wadden Sea with Global Positioning System data loggers to record their spatio-temporal patterns of departure from and arrival at their wintering site, and the first part of their spring migration. We obtained data for 42 migrations over 6 years, with 12 individuals performing repeat migrations in consecutive years. Day of year of departure and arrival was related to 38 meteorological and bird-related predictors using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify drivers of departure and arrival decisions.

Results: Curlews migrated almost exclusively to Arctic and sub-Arctic Russia for breeding. They left their wintering site mainly during the evening from mid- to late April and returned between the end of June and mid-July. There was no difference in departure times between the sexes. Weather parameters did not impact departure decisions; if departure days coincided with headwind conditions, the birds accounted for this by flying at higher altitudes of up to several kilometres. Curlews breeding further away in areas with late snowmelt departed later. Departures dates varied by only <4 days in individual curlews tagged over consecutive years.

Conclusions: These results suggest that the trigger for migration in this long-distance migrant is largely independent of weather conditions but is subject to resource availability in breeding areas. The high intra-individual repeatability of departure days among subsequent years and the lack of relationship to weather parameters suggest the importance of genetic triggers in prompting the start of migration. Further insights into the timing of migration in immatures and closely related birds might help to further unravel the genetic mechanisms triggering migration patterns.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-04-01 00:00:00.000,2020-07-31 23:59:44.000,801488,Numenius arquata,GPS,Philipp Schwemmer (Philipp Schwemmer)

However, relatively few studies have examined how animals respond to the landscape below them, which could affect speed and power allocation through modifications in climb rate and perceived predation risk. We equipped homing pigeons (Columba livia) with high frequency loggers to examine how flight speed, and hence effort, varies in relation to topography and land cover. Pigeons showed mixed evidence for an energy saving strategy, as they minimised climb rates by starting their ascent ahead of hills, but selected rapid speeds in their ascents. Birds did not modify their speed substantially in relation to land cover, but used higher speeds during descending flight, highlighting the importance of considering the rate of change in altitude before estimating power use from speed. Finally, we document an unexpected variability in speed and altitude over fine scales; a source of substantial energetic inefficiency. We suggest this may be a form of protean behaviour adopted to reduce predation risk when flocking is not an option, and that such a strategy could be widespread.

The proposed study aims to investigate how landscape structure and habitat quality affect spatial distribution and movements of white-lipped peccaries in tropical heterogeneous landscapes of Brazil, using distinct spatial scales of analysis. Species distribution modeling will be used to access environmental suitability for white-lipped peccary in regional scales of three different Brazilian biomes. Furthermore, individual based modeling and step selection functions will be used to investigate how landscape variables influence movement patterns and habitat selection for this species in landscape and patch scales in areas of the Pantanal and Cerrado.

Natural populations are not homogenous systems, but sets of individuals that use subsets of the species’ niche. This phenomenon is known as individual specialization. Recently, several studies found evidence of individual specialization, mainly among animals. Although diet and use of space are intrinsically connected to one another, studies on individual specialization have seldom assessed the latter.
2. Our goal is to help fill this gap in knowledge by testing individual specialization using yellow–shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) as a model and the new movement ecology paradigm as a framework.
3. First, we modeled as a network a system formed by individual bats and the landscape elements used by them. Second, to calculate overlap in individual activity areas as a proxy for specialization we developed a novel metric, the spatial individual specialization index (SpatIS). Finally, we tested fruit availability as a driver of interindividual differences in use of space. Ten individual bats were radio tracked in a heterogeneous Brazilian savanna. The density of their main food–plants was estimated and the number of activity points of each individual was counted.
4. There was large interindividual variation in the use of space not explained by sex or weight. Thus, our results point to individual specialization in the use of space in the studied population of S. lilium, which seems to be linked to food–plant distribution.
5. We conclude that individual specialization may affect the way a frugivore moves in space, with direct consequences for seed dispersal and landscape connectivity.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-07-11 15:00:00.000,2010-08-07 00:25:00.000,744,Sturnira lilium,Radio Transmitter,parogeri (Patricia Kerches-Rogeri)

In South Carolina, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is managed as a renewable natural resource, through public and private lands harvest programs. To date, South Carolina’s monitoring program for the species has primarily focused on abundance estimation but has not incorporated efforts to identify underlying mechanisms that may drive variation in realized or observed abundance patterns (e.g., habitat selection). Here we propose to conduct a movement ecology study of adult male alligators. We will deploy GPS transmitters in coastal South Carolina, within the Santee Delta and ACE Basin regions. Our objectives are to (1) quantify alligator movement patterns and sources of variation therein (e.g., individual, environmental, spatial); (2) determine if individual movement patterns among habitat types are consistent with patterns observed in nightlight survey counts; and (3) evaluate the use of reserves (e.g., Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center) in relation to harvest exposure. Objective 2 will allow us to derive more accurate population estimates by establishing potential bias in nightlight surveys and objective 3 will inform landscape-scale conservation planning (e.g., reserve design).",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2017-09-17 19:01:00.000,2018-01-01 04:02:30.000,576,Alligator mississippiensis,GPS,ajlawson (Abby Lawson)

From the 42 individuals tracked we found that foraging trips encompassed large areas of Hecate Strait, to the east of the colonies, and that birds travelled on average 453 km in 4.3 days for each foraging trip in 2018, and on average 263 km in 3.0 days in 2019. We used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to identify three movement behaviour states from track characteristics, which we classified as transit, resting and foraging. Immersion data collected from the GPS tags allowed us to differentiate between the two slow-moving states, and confidently identify foraging movement behaviour. Validation of movement behaviour states using time of day and immersion data suggested HMMs successfully identified daytime foraging locations, although nighttime socializing or resting may have been misclassified as foraging. Our results can inform marine conservation of this vulnerable species by differentiating foraging from other at-sea movement behaviours, and is a first step to identifying critical foraging habitat. The methods applied in this study to classify movement behaviours using data from small GPS devices can be used in future studies of this species and other similar small, diving seabirds.

For example, giant armadillos (Priodontes maximus) are the largest extant species of armadillo but are rarely encountered due to their fossorial and nocturnal behavior. Through the analysis of speed, turning angles, and accelerometer activity counts, we estimated behavioral states, characterized activity budgets, and investigated the state-habitat associations exhibited by individuals monitored with GPS telemetry in the Brazilian Pantanal from 2019 to 2020. This methodology is proposed as a useful framework for the identification of priority habitat. Using the non-parametric Bayesian mixture model for movement (M3), we estimated four latent behavioral states that were named ‘vigilance-excavation’, ‘local search’, ‘exploratory’, and ‘transit’. These states appeared to correspond with behavior near burrows or termite mounds, foraging, ranging, and rapid movements, respectively. The first and last hours of activity presented relatively high proportions of the vigilance-excavation state, while most of the activity period was dominated by local search and exploratory states. The vigilance-excavation state occurred more frequently in regions between forest and closed savannas, whereas local search was more likely in high proportions of closed savanna. Exploratory behavior probability increased in high proportions of both forest and closed savanna. Our results establish a baseline for behavioral complexity, activity budgets, and habitat associations in a pristine environment for future work that investigates anthropogenic impacts on giant armadillo behavior and fitness. The integration of accelerometer and GPS-derived movement data through our mixture model has the potential to become a powerful methodological approach for the conservation of other cryptic species.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2019-05-19 00:17:04.000,2020-01-24 01:26:12.000,13483,,GPS,nina.attias (Nina Attias)

Adult Marbled Murrelets were captured at night on the water during the pre-laying period (April 2014) in Wright Sound, near Hartley Bay, BC. Six birds were tagged with 5 g solar satellite transmitters. We had short-lived or no detections for two birds, detections for two weeks for three birds, and detections throughout the breeding season and beyond for one bird whose tag continued to transmit signals. Marine habitat use in relation to three alternative proposed tanker routes was examined for individual murrelets by using kernel density estimation to generate probability density functions of location, incorporating Argos location errors. Areas of high, medium and low encounter probabilities for each bird were generated. Use of marine habitats, coupled with a large population of birds in the area during the breeding season, suggests that there is a strong potential for interaction between tankers and murrelets along the proposed routes. However, based on the movement of one bird to south-central Alaska, individuals may migrate out of the area, reducing the likelihood of interactions post-breeding.

During this study (March 1998 – March 2002), 69 radiotracking flights occurred and sheep were located in every month of the year.

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. 

The primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of Dunlin during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. 

In 2017, we equipped 57 Dunlin at four Arctic-breeding locations (Canning River, Colville River, Prudhoe Bay, and Utqiagvik) with 1.2 g Pinpoint 10 GPS Swift tags (Lotek Wireless). These tags were programmed to collect 1 location every day from June 20 to October 16, then 1 location every three days from December 22 to February 8.  In 2018, we retrieved 6 of these tags (4 from Utqiaġvik, 1 from Colville River, and 1 Prudhoe Bay) for data download.  This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).

These migratory strategies may expose individuals to different threats, thus understanding migratory connectivity is crucial to assess risks to populations. Glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) are generalist predators with flexible migratory behaviour that may alter these behaviours in response to climate change and anthropogenic activities, such as access to landfills, yet little is known about their migration. We deployed GPS and GLS tracking devices on glaucous gulls from Coats Island, Nunavut, Canada to obtain the first insights into their migration and habitat use in the Canadian Arctic. Gulls used two migration strategies during the non-breeding season, where one migrated as far as the Sea of Okhotsk in the Pacific and the remainder (n = 7) wintered in the North Atlantic. Gulls primarily overwintered in pelagic (56%) and coastal (38%) habitats. While in coastal habitats, one gull visited one landfill once, but visits increased with a 1 km and 3 km buffer, suggesting that urban glaucous gulls primarily used non-landfill habitats. This research can be used as a baseline to explore changes in migratory behaviour and inform future conservation of Arctic-breeding gulls.

Nevertheless, anosmic pigeons, Columba livia, show unimpaired navigation when released within a familiar area, suggesting that they may rely on familiar visual landmarks for navigation. However, direct evidence for the reliance on familiar visual landmarks during homing in anosmic birds has never been provided. In this study we tracked pigeons subjected singly to one training flight from each of three locations. Prior to their second release from each site, half of the birds were made anosmic while the others were not manipulated. The level of route fidelity was analysed separately for three phases of the homing process, in which familiar visual cues may have different relevance and may be used within different cognitive strategies: (1) ‘Initial decision making’; (2) ‘En route navigation’; (3) ‘Local navigation around home’. Compared to control birds, the anosmic birds flew significantly closer to previously overflown locations in the ‘En route navigation’ phase, while no difference in route fidelity emerged during phases (1) and (3). Our results showed that a single experience is sufficient for pigeons to learn release site features, and that familiar visual landmarks constitute a critical source of navigational information in olfactorily deprived birds during the homing process.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2017-07-05 07:36:42.000,2017-07-25 08:33:16.000,2541223,Columba livia,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

Avian Biol.),15,15,15,,,," In the vast majority of migratory bird species studied so far, spring migration has been found to proceed faster than autumn migration. In spring, selection pressures for rapid migration are purportedly higher, and migratory conditions such as food supply, daylength, and/or wind support may be better than in autumn. In swans, however, spring migration appears to be slower than autumn migration. Based on a comparison of tundra swan  Cygnus columbianus  tracking data with long-term temperature data from wheather stations, it has previously been suggested that this was due to a capital breeding strategy (gathering resources for breeding during spring migration) and/or to ice cover constraining spring but not autumn migration. Here we directly test the hypothesis that Bewick ’ s swans  Cygnus columbianus bewickii follow the ice front in spring, but not in autumn, by comparing three years of GPS tracking data from individual swans with concurrent ice cover data at ﬁ ve important migratory stop-over sites. In general, ice constrained the swans in the middle part of spring migration, but not in the ﬁ rst (no ice cover was present in the ﬁ rst part) nor in the last part. In autumn, the swans migrated far ahead of ice formation, possibly in order to prevent being trapped by an early onset of winter. We conclude that spring migration in swans is slower than autumn migration because spring migration speed is constrained by ice cover. This restriction to spring migration speed may be more common in northerly migrating birds that rely on freshwater resources. This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).

Though the migration of the species has been widely discussed in the literature, researchers know little about the migration patterns of the subspecies in Asia (Otis tarda dybowskii), especially the males. In 2018 and 2019, we captured six O. t. dybowskii (five males and one female) at their breeding sites in eastern Mongolia and tagged them with GPS-GSM satellite transmitters. This constitutes the first time that the Great Bustards of the eastern subspecies have been tracked in eastern Mongolia. We found sex differences in migration patterns: males started migration later but arrived earlier than the female in the spring; males had 1/3 of the migration duration and migrated about 1/2 the distance of the female. Additionally, Great Bustards exhibited high fidelity to their breeding, post-breeding, and wintering sites. For conservation, only 22.51% of GPS location fixes of bustards were within protected areas, and less than 5.0% for wintering sites and during migration. Within two years, half of the Great Bustards we tracked died at their wintering sites or during migration. We recommend establishing more protected areas at wintering sites and rerouting or undergrounding powerlines in areas where Great Bustards are densely distributed to eliminate collisions",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2018-09-11 07:00:00.000,2020-11-27 00:00:00.000,62700,Otis tarda,GPS,Ciel (Ying-Jun Wang)

These parameters were modelled against wind speed and direction, time of the day, solar irradiance (proxy of thermal uplift), starting altitude and distance to Morocco, and age and sex of birds. We found that sea crossing performance of black kites is driven by their age, the wind conditions, the starting altitude and the starting distance to Morocco. Young birds assumed more risks than adults by making longer sea crossings and reaching lower altitude above the sea. Crosswinds promoted longer sea crossings, with birds reaching lower altitudes and with higher flapping effort. Birds starting at lower altitudes were more likely to quit or made higher flapping effort to complete the sea crossing. The location where the birds started the sea crossings impacted crossing distance and duration.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2012-08-09 10:59:42.000,2013-09-06 15:26:03.000,27630,Milvus migrans,GPS,cdsantos

However, due to limitations in the transmission abilities of the Argos system and the battery life of the tags, very little is known about fine-scale diving behaviour over time or the reliability of assigning behavioral states from horizontal movement data for whale species. Whether whales swim close to the ocean surface or complete drift dives into deeper parts of the water column while migrating has not been examined, yet the strategy used is likely to influence the vulnerability of whales to risk factors such as ship strike. Here we present information from a rare week long deployment onto a pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) that provided the first opportunity to examine the long-term diving behaviour of a migrating whale, and to compare the location of feeding lunges to assigned behavioural states.

Documenting movements and identifying areas used by raptors before they enter a breeding population is important for understanding the factors that influence their survival. In North America, juvenile Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) are routinely observed outside the species’ breeding range during the nonbreeding season, but the natal origins of these birds are rarely known. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of juvenile Gyrfalcons during their first months of independence. We instrumented nestlings with lightweight satellite transmitters within 10 d of estimated fledging dates on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska and in Denali National Park (Denali) in interior Alaska. Gyrfalcons spent an average of 41.4 6 6.1 d (range 5 30–50 d) in their natal areas after fledging. The mean departure date from natal areas was 27 August 6 6.4 d. We tracked 15 individuals for an average of 70.5 6 28.1 d post-departure; Gyrfalcons moved from 105 to 4299 km during this period and tended to move greater distances earlier in the tracking period than later in the tracking period. Gyrfalcons did not establish temporary winter ranges within the tracking period. We identified several movement patterns among Gyrfalcons, including unidirectional long-distance movements, multidirectional long- and short- distance movements, and shorter movements within a local region. Gyrfalcons from the Seward Peninsula remained in western Alaska or flew to eastern Russia with no movements into interior Alaska. In contrast, Gyrfalcons from Denali remained in interior Alaska, flew to northern and western Alaska, or flew to northern Alberta. Gyrfalcons from both study areas tended to move to coastal, riparian, and wetland areas during autumn and early winter. Because juvenile Gyrfalcons dispersed over a large geographic area and across three international boundaries, conservation efforts should focus on both regional and international scales.

32 Campus Drive, Missoula, MT 59812",joshua.millspaugh@mso.umt.edu,,"Examining the ways in which animals use habitat and select resources to satisfy their life history requirements has important implications for ecology, evolution, and conservation. The advent of radio-tracking in the mid-20th century greatly expanded the scope of animal-habitat modeling. Thereafter, it became common practice to aggregate telemetry data collected on a number of tagged individuals and fit one model describing resource selection at the population level. This convention however, runs the risk of masking important individuality in the nature of associations between animals and their environment. Here we investigated the importance of individual variation in animal-habitat relationships via the study of a highly gregarious species. We modeled elk (Cervus elaphus) location data, collected from Global Positioning System (GPS) collars, using Bayesian discrete choice resource selection function (RSF) models. Using a high-performance computing cluster we batch-processed these models at the level of each individual elk (n = 88) and evaluated the output with respect to: i) the composition of parameters in the most supported models, ii) the estimates of the parameters featured in the global models, and iii) spatial maps of the predicted relative probabilities of use. We detected considerable individual variation across all three metrics. For instance, the most supported models varied with respect to parameter composition with a range of seven to 17 and an average of 14.4 parameters per individual elk. The estimates of the parameters featured in the global models also varied greatly across individual elk with little conformity detected across age or sex classes. Finally, spatial mapping illustrated stark differences in the predicted relative probabilities of use across individual elk. Our analysis identifies that animal-habitat relationships, even among the most gregarious of species, can be highly variable. We discuss the implications of our results for ecology and present some guiding principles for the development of RSF models at the individual-animal level.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2011-06-01 00:00:00.000,2014-09-15 00:00:00.000,33505,Cervus elaphus,GPS,montg164 (Dr. Robert A.

The solution is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization including the skillful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most favorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we address the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions birds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were taken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential parameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common features in the ways birds and humans use thermals. In particular, falcons seem to reproduce the MacCready formula widely used by gliders to calculate the best slope to take before an upcoming thermal.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2006-07-01 03:51:32.000,2006-07-19 15:58:09.000,90706,"Falco ",GPS,nagymate (Mate Nagy)

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. 

The primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of Semipalmated Sandpipers during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. 

In 2017, we equipped 68 Semipalmated Sandpipers at four Arctic-breeding locations (Canning River, Colville River, Prudhoe Bay, and Utqiagvik) with 1.2 g Pinpoint 10 GPS Swift tags (Lotek Wireless). These tags were programmed to collect 1 location every day from June 20 to September 15, then 1 location every three days from November 6 to March 23.

Few details are known about the annual cycle of this elusive species. We studied movements and breeding in water rails from southernmost Norway where the species occurs year‐round. Colour‐ringed wintering birds occurred only occasionally at the study site in summer, and vice versa. Geolocator tracks revealed that wintering birds (n = 10) migrated eastwards in spring to breed on both sides of the Baltic Sea, whereas a single breeding bird from the study site wintered in N Italy. Ambient light records of geolocator birds further indicated that all but one incubated 2–4 clutches per season. By combining information on incubation and movement, we found evidence for itinerant breeding in three individual birds: After a first breeding attempt (one did not incubate), all moved 129–721 km to breed again. This behaviour is rarely recorded in birds and was unexpected because the water rail is described as monogamous with both parents caring for eggs and chicks. The study greatly improves our knowledge about the annual cycle and reproduction in water rails. However, more studies are warranted to evaluate the generality of our findings and causes of breeding itinerancy.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-02-01 16:06:14.000,2016-03-28 18:20:14.000,173,Rallus aquaticus,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw",terje.lislevand (Terje Lislevand)

Our understanding, however, of the strategies used in pursuit and evasion remains limited. Here we report on the hunting dynamics of the world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. Using miniaturized data loggers, we recorded fine-scale movement, speed and acceleration of free-ranging cheetahs to measure how hunting dynamics relate to chasing different sized prey. Cheetahs attained hunting speeds of up to 18.94 m/s and accelerated up to 7.5 m/s2 with greatest angular velocities achieved during the terminal phase of the hunt. The interplay between forward and lateral acceleration during chases showed that the total forces involved in speed changes and turning were approximately constant over time but varied with prey type. Thus, rather than a simple maximum speed chase, cheetahs first accelerate to decrease the distance to their prey, before reducing speed 5-8 s from the end of the hunt, so as to facilitate rapid turns to match prey escape tactics, varying the precise strategy according to prey species. Predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against manoeuvring capability in a race for survival.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2012-02-09 05:16:02.000,2012-04-04 15:53:40.000,35308,Acinonyx jubatus,GPS,johnnybirder (John W Wilson)

The tracks were used in Lisovksi et al. 2021 to describe their migration pattern and compared them with optimal migration routes for wind and reseource availability. 

We found that in autumn, theoretical wind driven migration routes formed a broad-front corridor connecting Europe and the Indian Subcontinent while the theoretical resource driven routes formed a distinct north-south divide. The latter pattern was also reflected the rosefinch tracks with all but the most southerly breeding birds making a northern detour towards non-breeding sites in Pakistan and India. In spring, the resource availability model predicted a similar migratory divide, however, the southern route seemed relatively more favourable and closely matched with the optimal wind driven migration routes. Spring tracking data showed larger overlap with the modelled wind driven migration routes compared to the resource driven routes.

We conclude, that optimal wind and resource driven migration routes along the Indo-European flyway are seasonally specific and to a large extend do not overlap with one another. Under these conditions, migratory birds adopt seasonally distinct migration strategies following energy minimization strategy in autumn, driven by resource availability, and time minimizing strategy in spring, driven by wind conditions. Our optimal migration models can be applied worldwide and used to validate against empirical data to explain large-scale biogeographic pattern of migratory animals.

Walruses winter together in the Bering Sea but females with calves and subadults summer in the Chukchi Sea using sea ice as a resting platform while feeding on the shallow sea floor; whereas most adult males remain in the Bering Sea where they use terrestrial haulouts for resting. The rapid retreat of sea ice in recent years is changing walrus summer habitat in the Chukchi Sea and may be changing summer distribution and haulout behavior, requiring that walruses haul out on land instead of ice. Oil and gas activity has recently increased in the Chukchi Sea, increasing the importance of improving our understanding of walrus movements, feeding behavior, and habitat requirements to develop effective mitigation measures for the conservation and management of the species. Satellite-linked transmitters placed on walruses near the communities of Little Diomede, Shishmaref, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, and Barrow in spring, summer, and fall would provide information on movements, speed of travel, feeding areas, and haulout behavior. Working cooperatively with the Eskimo Walrus Commission and walrus hunters from these communities, we have designed a study to deploy satellite transmitters and conduct counts and observations of walruses on haulouts near villages in spring and fall. Traditional ecological knowledge will also be collected and integrated into the results. These data will provide information that will help answer important questions about walrus movements, feeding areas, haulout behavior, migration timing, and body condition that will improve our understanding of habitats important to walruses. The study will be conducted over a 5-year period, is designed so that is does not interfere with subsistence walrus hunting activities and is funded by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).

The Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata is globally Near Threatened and considered one of the UK’s most pressing avian conservation priorities. Designing effective conservation interventions and prioritising site protection requires knowledge of the habitat requirements of breeding Curlews, inside and outside of designated sites. The Exe and Taw-Torridge Estuaries, in South-West England are both designated Special Protection Areas (SPA), qualifying in part because each support nationally important numbers of wintering waders and waterbirds. Part of this assemblage are Eurasian Curlew and due to concerns regarding their population trend, this partnership project was established. This tracking study will investigate, in high detail, the use and relative importance of estuary sites as well as functionally linked non-designated habitats and where possible shed light on the migration routes and breed sites used by Curlews wintering in South-west England.  This information will be used to inform local conservation policy and management.

Using high-frequency movement data, we identified thermal soaring in a seabird previously thought to use only flapping flight; red-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda). We tracked 55 individuals breeding on Round Island, Mauritius, and examined the environmental conditions that predicted thermal soaring in 76 trips (ranging from 0.8 to 43 h, mean= 5.9 h). Tropicbirds used thermal soaring for 13% of their flight time on average (range 0 - 34%). Our results suggest that the profitability and use of thermal soaring was influenced by the wind, with birds more likely to soar when flying with tail winds. This should enable birds to reduce the amount of flapping flight without experiencing a substantial increase in trip duration. Birds may be able to increase the amount of thermal soaring outside the breeding season when they are less constrained by time and the need to return to a central place. This could lead to notable seasonal differences in flight-related energy expenditure in a range of seabirds, given that thermal soaring is not restricted to seabirds with morphological adaptations for slow flight.

In the German Bight of the North Sea, two subspecies of the northern wheatear split travelling routes, with Greenlandic/Icelandic breeders (subspecies leucorhoa) facing a long over-sea flight and Scandinavian breeding birds (subspecies oenanthe) travelling further roughly along the coast. We used automated radio-telemetry in spring to show that leucorhoa birds stayed significantly longer at a coastal stopover site and clearly selected for favourable weather, especially easterly winds, when resuming flights Conditions for departures of individuals from the subspecies oenanthe were less obvious. They were more likely to depart on nights with southerly winds, often along with rising air temperatures, while air pressure dropped. Individuals of subspecies leucorhoa thus wait for optimal flying conditions to resume for longer flights, while oenanthe birds, with shorter distances ahead, seem to optimise time by leaving the stopover site more quickly. Our dataset thus confirms that songbirds optimise stopover based on their (sub)species-specific migration patterns.

How birds use the western Beaufort Sea and other marine waters is unclear, and this information is needed to model the potential effects of off-shore oil and gas development. We used satellite telemetry (PTTs) to characterize migration and to identify wintering and staging areas of eiders and long-tailed ducks that molt in lagoons and other marine waters along the western Beaufort Sea coast. The primary objectives of this study were to locate and describe migration corridors, staging areas, and habitats used by eiders and long-tailed ducks during fall and spring migrations and compare and contrast migration strategies of these two species. Additional information can be obtained from the authors.

To describe woodcock migration patterns and phenology, we captured and equipped 73 woodcock with satellite tracking devices in the Central Management Region (analogous to the Mississippi Flyway) of North America and documented migration paths of 60 individual woodcock and 87 autumn or spring woodcock migrations during 2014–2016. Woodcock migration at the scale of the Central Management Region was more synchronous in spring than in autumn, but unlike most other migratory birds, average duration of autumn migration (31 days) was shorter than duration of spring migration (53 days). This difference in migration duration resulted from woodcock making more close-together migratory stopovers during spring migration, not because woodcock had individual stopovers of longer duration. During autumn migration, the number of days, the number of stopovers, migration end date and net migration displacement were negatively related to initiation date and rate of migration, and the number of stopovers and the net migration displacement were negatively related with migration end date. Spring migration duration, end date, the number of stopovers and net migration displacement were negatively related to migration rate and initiation date was positively related to migration rate, suggesting that woodcock that initiated spring migration later had faster migration rates. Juvenile female woodcock began spring migration later than adult female woodcock. Our results provide a basis for comparing current harvest seasons with presence of migrating woodcock during autumn and provide insight into differential harvest of migratory versus local woodcock on breeding areas.

These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. We examined the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, as spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but during periods of resource limitation (dry season), also rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas) especially in the dry season. Leopard and cheetah overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviours and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. The smallest species (African wild dog) avoided lions and used multiple tactics to minimise encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially-explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2000-09-02 06:23:00.000,2005-11-30 16:47:00.000,35723,"Panthera leo,Panthera pardus,Acinonyx jubatus,Lycaon pictus",Radio Transmitter,abivanak (Abi Tamim Vanak)

GPS‐tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri‐axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount or raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission.
2. Here we propose compressing the raw ACC data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity.
3. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) collected in spring 2017. By using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. 
4. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a 6 time reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals’ time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals.
5. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well‐considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately these developments can allow for long‐term and nearly continuous remote‐monitoring of the behaviour of free‐ranging animals.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2017-02-01 00:00:14.000,2017-05-31 23:46:24.000,96373,Cygnus columbianus,"GPS,Acceleration,Accessory Measurements",RaschaN (Rascha Nuijten)

Our initial samples were 34 Swainson's Hawks from representative areas of their breeding range, and 61 Peregrine Falcons captured at nest sites across the North American boreal forest and low Arctic or on the migration routes along the mid-Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The average distance of migration for Peregrines was 8,624 km southward, and 8,247 km northward. Peregrines travelled at an average rate of 172 km/d southward and 198 km/d going north. Peregrine Falcons used at least three broad, general routes south from the breeding areas, and individuals stopped migrating as far north as the U.S.A. mid-Atlantic coast and as far south as central Argentina. The radiomarked Peregrine Falcons used coastal routes, mid-continental routes, and water-crossing routes: the Davis Strait and Caribbean Sea. During northward migration, Peregrines migrating through at Padre Island, Texas diverged for destinations from central Alaska across the continent to central West Greenland. Swainson's Hawks migrated an average of about 13,504 km southward and 11,952 km northward, and travelled 188 km/d southward and 150 km/d northward. Swainson's Hawks converged in eastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Southward, these hawks followed a narrow, well-defined path through Central America, across the Andes Mountains in Columbia, and east of the Andes to central Argentina where they all spent the austral summer.

Aims: To determine autumn and spring migration routes, the location and duration of stopover sites on migration, and the location of non-breeding areas of British breeding Wood Warblers.
Methods: In 2016 and 2018 we deployed geolocators to male Wood Warblers on Dartmoor, Devon, and in the New Forest, Hampshire. We retrieved four geolocators from returning birds in 2017, 2019, and 2020.
Results: Male Wood Warblers departed breeding sites in late July and stopped for most of August in central southern Europe, crossed the Sahara by a non-stop night and day flight immediately followed by a short stop, and then migrated west to a longer stopover in the Sahel. Final non-breeding destinations were in an area of West Africa covering Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Two were tracked on spring migration, again crossing the Sahara via a non-stop flight before migrating through Western Europe to complete a clockwise loop migration back to Britain.
Conclusion: All tracked Wood Warblers used stopovers for at least three weeks in three distinct regions, in central southern Europe, in the Sahel, and in the humid zone of West Africa. Although the limitations of geolocation prevent matching locations with habitat, these regions are broadly characterized by distinct forest or woodland habitat types, which differ from breeding habitat. All four tracks showed similar patterns in route, stopover behaviour, and timings, suggesting they may be representative of males in these breeding populations, and potentially of other British and western European Wood Warbler populations.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2016-06-22 04:23:00.000,2019-05-21 03:48:00.000,2163,Phylloscopus sibilatrix,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight",malcburgess (Malcolm Burgess)

The use of public information can lead to the aggrega- tion of foragers at prey patches, a mechanism known as local enhancement. However, when ephemeral resources are distributed over large areas, foragers may also need to increase search efficiency, and thus apply social strategies when sampling the landscape. While sensory networks of visually oriented animals have already been confirmed, we lack an understanding of how acoustic eavesdropping adds to the formation of sensory networks. Here we radio-tracked a total of 81 aerial-hawking bats at very high spatio- temporal resolution during five sessions over 3 y, recording up to 19 individuals simul- taneously. Analyses of interactive flight behavior provide conclusive evidence that bats form temporary mobile sensory networks by adjusting their movements to neighboring conspecifics while probing the airspace for prey. Complementary agent-based simula- tions confirmed that the observed movement patterns can lead to the formation of mobile sensory networks, and that bats located prey faster when networking than when relying only on local enhancement or searching solitarily. However, the benefitof net- working diminished with decreasing group size. The combination of empirical analyses and simulations elucidates how animal groups use acoustic information to efficiently locate unpredictable and ephemeral food patches. Our results highlight that declining local populations of social foragers may thus suffer from Allee effects that increase the risk of collapses under global change scenarios, like insect decline and habitat degradation.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2018-05-12 19:04:11.000,2020-08-02 20:51:15.000,126097,Nyctalus noctula,Radio Transmitter,manuelroeleke (Manuel Roeleke)

,,,,false,1415433975,false,,42.5,-125.5,Gray whales Oregon and Northern California 2009-2013 - Argos data,33,32,33,,,,"There is a lack of detailed information about the range and habitat use of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) during their seasonal occupation off the Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast from northern California to southeast Alaska, USA. These data are important for management because of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., indigenous harvesting, fishing gear entanglements, ship strikes, naval exercises, siting of marine renewable energy facilities). We applied satellite tags to 35 gray whales in the eastern north Pacific (ENP) off the coasts of Oregon and northern California from September to December 2009, 2012, and 2013. These whales are members of the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a subset of gray whales in the ENP that feed off the PNW, during summer and fall. Tracking periods for the satellite‐tagged whales in this study ranged from 3 days to 383 days. We applied a Bayesian switching state‐space model (SSSM) to locations for each whale track to provide a regularized track with 2 estimated locations per day and associated movement behavior (either transiting or area‐restricted searching [ARS]). We isolated the portion of the SSSM track in the feeding area for each whale by removing all southward and northward migration locations. We calculated home ranges (90% isopleths) and core areas (50% isopleths) for these non‐migrating, feeding‐area tracks with >50 SSSM locations using local convex hull utilization distributions. Feeding‐area home ranges for the resulting 23 whales covered most of the near‐shore waters from northern California to Icy Bay, Alaska, and ranged in size from 81 km2 to 13,634 km2. Core areas varied widely in size (11–3,976 km2) and location between individuals, with the highest‐use areas off Point St. George in northern California, the central coast of Oregon, and the southern coast of Washington, USA. Nearshore waters off Point St. George were a hot spot for whales in the PCFG in late fall, close to where most of the whales were tagged; 19 whales had overlapping home ranges and 15 whales had overlapping core areas there. One whale, a male tracked for 383 days, did not migrate, spending the entire winter off Point St. George and the California‐Oregon border. Residence times (portions of the track with a minimum of 3 successive locations in ARS behavioral mode) ranged from 1 day to 142.5 days; 19 whales had residencies >30 days in some areas. Because most of the whales in this study were tagged in the fall in the southern portion of the feeding area, off northern California, results are weighted toward fall and winter movements. Although some whales were tracked into the spring and summer, additional tagging earlier in the year and in more northerly locations would provide an even clearer picture of gray whale use of feeding areas in the PNW. Nevertheless, these results constitute valuable information about high‐use areas for gray whales in this region, providing baseline home range data for future comparisons with regard to year‐to‐year variability, potential responses to climate change, and exposure to anthropogenic activities in the marine environment.

However, most of these energy sources are not thought to be available at night because of the lower thermal potential in the nocturnal atmosphere, as well as the difficulty of locating features that generate uplift. Despite this, several bat species have been observed hundreds to thousands of meters above the ground. Individuals make repeated, energetically costly high-altitude ascents, and others fly at some of the fastest speeds observed for powered vertebrate flight. We hypothesized that bats use orographic uplift to reach high altitudes, and that both this uplift and bat high-altitude ascents would be highly predictable. By superimposing detailed three-dimensional GPS tracking of European free-tailed bats (Tadarida teniotis) on high-resolution regional wind data, we show that bats do indeed use the energy of orographic uplift to climb to over 1,600 m, and also that they reach maximum sustained self-powered airspeeds of 135 km h−1. We show that wind and topography can predict areas of the landscape able to support high-altitude ascents, and that bats use these locations to reach high altitudes while reducing airspeeds. Bats then integrate wind conditions to guide high-altitude ascents, deftly exploiting vertical wind energy in the nocturnal landscape.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2017-08-08 20:15:30.000,2017-08-15 03:59:05.000,9873,Tadarida teniotis,GPS,teague_o (Teague O'Mara)

Here we report the results of a pilot satellite tracking study aimed at establishing the scale of movement of the straw-coloured fruit bat Eidolon helvum. This was the first ever attempt to track African fruit bats using satellite telemetry. We tagged four bats with solar-charged 12 g satellite transmitters at Kasanka National Park in December 2005 and obtained a combined total of 104 different location fixes over a 149-day period. Before migrating, bats foraged as far as 59 km from the roost in a single evening; by contrast, one migrating individual moved 370 km in one night. Bats travelled an average 29 km day−1 over the period of study, with bats that appeared to be migrating moving north-west from Kasanka at an average 90 km day−1. The greatest cumulative distance travelled by a single bat was 2518 km in 149 days. The results show conclusively that the straw-coloured fruit bat E. helvum is capable of migrating thousands of kilometres across central Africa on an annual basis, implying that the fruit pulse in northern Zambia is richer than anything on offer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the same time of the year.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2005-12-01 15:42:20.000,2006-06-15 09:05:40.000,102,Eidolon helvum,Argos Doppler Shift,gscumming (Graeme Cumming)

This project continued during the winters of 2004 - 2006.

Scoter populations across the North American continent have undergone dramatic declines during the past 40 years. Scoters populations wintering in the Washington State portions of the Salish Sea have been documented to have been declining since 1978. In order to better understand some of the factors that may be causing these declines, the locations of the spring staging, summer nesting, and fall molting grounds were documented, as well as the migratory paths from, and back to, the wintering grounds.

Gulls often use human-impacted landscapes and may respond to changes by altering their feeding ecology. We investigated the foraging behavior of individual common gulls (Larus canus), focusing on their distribution during foraging and their selected habitat types. We tracked adult common gulls using GPS telemetry at their largest breeding colony in the southwestern Baltic Sea, Germany. Foraging habitats were analyzed from tracking data for three breeding seasons 2016, 2017, and 2019 and were compared with potentially available foraging habitats. Most breeding birds flew toward terrestrial areas. Feeding sites were located on average 11.7–14.3 km from the colony (range 0.9–36.5 km). Corn and sugar beet fields were used significantly and extensively compared with their availability in 2016 and 2017, while wheat, rape, and barley fields were used significantly less. Data from 2019 suggested seasonal shifts in habitat use. Birds spent between 30 and 1300 min per week at their preferred feeding sites, with significant differences between the major habitats selected. We found a stable, clear, multiyear pattern in common gull foraging behavior in relation to agricultural practices. Fields with little or no crop cover and thus access to the soil were preferred over fields with high crop cover. These results suggest that local food availability may be limiting further population increases in this species.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2016-05-14 13:10:08.000,2023-09-11 11:20:45.000,1558537,Larus canus,"GPS,Acceleration",stefangarthe (Stefan Garthe)

On oceanic islands, flying-foxes are often the only seed dispersers or pollinators. However, many flying-fox populations are currently in decline, particularly those of insular species, and this has consequences for the ecological services they provide. Knowledge of the drivers and the scale of flying-fox movements are important in determining the ecological roles that flying-foxes play on islands. This information is also useful for understanding the potential long-term consequences for forest dynamics resulting from population declines or extinction, and so can aid in the development of evidence-based ecological management strategies. We examined the foraging movements, floral resource use, and social interactions to explain how intrinsic factors (body mass, skeletal size, and sex) affected the extent of foraging movements of the Critically Endangered Christmas Island flying-fox (Pteropus natalis). Our findings suggest that smaller P. natalis individuals are the primary vectors of long-distance dispersal of pollen and digested seeds in this species, providing a vital mechanism for maintaining the flow of plant genetic diversity across Christmas Island. Overall, our study highlights the need for more holistic research approaches that incorporate population demographics when assessing a species’ ecological services.

However, flexibility in migratory behavior may allow effective coping with unpredictable variation in ecological conditions that can occur during migration. We aimed at characterizing inter- and intraindividual variation of migratory behavior in a forest-dwelling wader species, the Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola, focusing on spatio-temporal consistency across repeated migration episodes. By satellite-tracking birds from their wintering sites along the Italian peninsula to their breeding areas, we disclosed a remarkable variability in migration distances, with some birds flying more than 6,000 km to Central Asian breeding grounds (up to 101°E). Prebreeding migration was faster and of shorter duration than postbreeding migration. Birds moving over longer distances migrated faster during prebreeding migration, and those breeding at northernmost latitudes left their wintering areas earlier. Moreover, birds making longer migrations departed earlier from their breeding sites. Breeding site fidelity was very high, whereas fidelity to wintering areas increased with age. Migration routes were significantly consistent, both among repeated migration episodes and between pre- and postbreeding migration. Prebreeding migration departure date was not significantly repeatable, whereas arrival date to the breeding areas was highly repeatable. Hence, interindividual variation in migratory behavior of woodcocks was mostly explained by the location of the breeding areas, and spatial consistency was relatively large through the entire annual cycle. Flexibility in prebreeding migration departure date may suggest that environmental effects have a larger influence on temporal than on spatial aspects of migratory behavior.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2011-03-18 01:57:59.000,2017-08-16 06:39:09.000,5923,Scolopax rusticola,Argos Doppler Shift,diego.rubolini (Diego Rubolini)

In the current study, we employed GPS-tracking technology and unilateral HF lesions to further explore what if any aspects of a pigeon’s homing flight might be under dominant control by either the left or right HF. Pigeons were released from three locations prior to any experimental manipulation and released repeatedly from the same three sites as sham-lesioned control, right HF-lesioned and left HF-lesioned treatment groups. Analyses of homing performance and virtual vanishing bearings revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A more in-depth analysis of path efficiency during the initial decision-making, en route and near home phases of a homing flight also revealed no effect of either lesion treatment. A last analysis on the learning and memory for positions along a previously flown route, a proxy for investigating the development of route fidelity, also revealed no effect of either unilateral lesion. However, independent of treatment group, some statistically significant effects were observed with respect to changes in performance across training and the different release sites. The current study revealed no detectable difference between the left and right HF-lesioned pigeons with respect to several navigational parameters of a homing flight.

South Africa",arjun.amar@uct.ac.za,,"The Martial Eagle is a low-density apex predator currently declining across its African range. Changes in reporting rates from bird atlas surveys suggest declines of up to 60 % over the last 20 years (1987-1982 vs. 2007-2013) across South Africa. Worryingly, large protected areas were not immune to these declines. For instance reporting rates in Kruger National Park (KNP; ca. 20,000 km2), an area often considered a stronghold for Martial Eagles, recorded a 54 % decline in reporting rates. It is not clear what the major drivers of declines have been in South Africa, nor what is contributing to the declines in these large protected areas. In this study we investigate the ecology of Martial Eagles in KNP to improve our understanding of the threats they face and how these threats at various stages in their life cycle may be driving declines within protected areas where one would expect that the species should be well conserved.

Scoter populations across the North American continent have undergone dramatic declines during the past 40 years. Scoters populations wintering in the Washington State portions of the Salish Sea have been documented to have been declining since 1978. In order to better understand some of the factors that may be causing these declines, the locations of the spring staging, summer nesting, and fall molting grounds were documented, as well as the migratory paths from, and back to, the wintering grounds.

A standard practice for mammalian surveys is to place cameras on roads, trails, and paths to maximize detections and/or increase efficiency in the field. However, for many species it is unclear whether track‐based camera surveys provide reliable estimates of population density. (2) Understanding how the spatial arrangement of camera traps affects population density estimates is of key interest to contemporary conservationists and managers given the rapid increase in camera‐based wildlife surveys. (3) We evaluated the effect of camera‐trap placement, using several survey designs, on density estimates of a widespread mesopredator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, over a two‐year period in a semi‐arid conservation reserve in south‐eastern Australia. Further, we used the certainty in the identity and whereabouts of individuals (via GPS collars) to assess how resighting rates of marked foxes affect density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially explicit mark–resight methods. (4) Fox detection rates were much higher at cameras placed on tracks compared with off‐track cameras, yet in the majority of sessions, camera placement had relatively little effect on point estimates of density. However, for each survey design, the precision of density estimates varied considerably across sessions, influenced heavily by the absolute number of marked foxes detected, the number of times marked foxes was resighted, and the number of detection events of unmarked foxes. (5) Our research demonstrates that the precision of population density estimates using spatially explicit mark–resight models is sensitive to resighting rates of identifiable individuals. Nonetheless, camera surveys based either on‐ or off‐track can provide reliable estimates of population density using spatially explicit mark–resight models. This underscores the importance of incorporating information on the spatial behavior of the subject species when planning camera‐trap surveys.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2015-10-07 20:40:39.000,2017-11-21 10:40:36.000,94187,Vulpes vulpes,GPS,droshier (David Roshier)

To examine unsupervised dog movements into wilderness, we attached Global Positioning System devices to 33 village and four rural dogs on a sub-Antarctic island in Chile during the four seasons of a year (n = 86115 locations). This corresponded to a quarter of the local free-ranging dog population based on a photographic mark-recapture survey. The longest maximum distance to the owner´s home was 20.4 km. The median home range size ranged between 15.8 (spring) and 24.4 ha (summer), but with great individual variation (1.6 ha - 148.8 km2). Nine individuals had home ranges > 100 ha in at least one seasonal monitoring; seven individuals performed excursions spending 1–6 nights in pristine nature, and two individuals accompanied tourists on trekking trips lasting 3–6 days. Remarkably, village dogs were quite active at night (40.7% of the locations). Top-ranked habitats in the compositional analysis of habitat use of village dogs were forest and infrastructure. However, coasts were also important at second order and peatbog at third order habitat selection. Our study revealed a high temporal and spatial plasticity of dog movement in sub-Antarctic ecosystems, likely interacting with wildlife. We conclude that future research should address predictors of problematic animals, which have been treated as “outliers” in many studies. In Chile, the control of legislation and education beyond the mere owner should be improved wherever dogs occur near sensitive wilderness areas.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,GPS,Elke (Elke Schüttler)

Via a long-term study of little auks breeding in East Greenland (Liverpool Land), in place since 2005, but also through specific experimental and modelling approaches, as well as through a panarctic network of collaborations, we test the following hypotheses: (1) Arctic climate change is impacting the trophic status, the foraging ecology, the reproductive output, the body condition and the multi-annual survival of adult little auks during the breeding season. (2) Ongoing climate change impacts the migratory ecophysiology of little auks in the North Atlantic. (3) Flight and diving energetics condition the functional ecology of little auks, among the world’s smallest diving marine homeotherms. (4) Climate change is generating thermal stress for arctic seabirds, with impacts on their reproductive performances. (5) Environmental contamination impacts little auk ecophysiology, behaviour and breeding success, with long-term population effects. (6). The pan-arctic seabird community functions as a natural monitoring network for both legacy and emerging contaminants. All of our work participates in the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (CBMP) of the working group Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) of the Arctic Council, and therefore corresponds to the expectations of arctic peoples in terms of environmental research. This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2009-08-22 01:14:00.000,2015-05-11 02:05:52.000,45540,Alle alle,Solar Geolocator,david.gremillet (David Grémillet)

These studies highlighted the complexity of long-distance navigation in homing pigeons, which remains a poorly investigated aspect. In this tracking study we report how the homing performances of pigeons housed in Amino (Pisa, Italy) were affected by the presence/absence of a mountain range (the Northern Apennines) interposed between the home and the release site area (release sites: Trans = mountain barrier, Cis = no mountain barrier). We displaced unmanipulated control pigeons, anosmic pigeon, and pigeons transported in purified air to release sites located at a distance ranging between 95 and 246 km from home. There, birds were released without further manipulation. The navigational performances of anosmic pigeons were impaired at both Cis and Trans sites compared to both smelling groups. Both unmanipulated control pigeons and pigeons transported in purified air but allowed to smell environmental air at both the release site and after release displayed unimpaired navigational abilities at the Cis site, but impaired homing success and impaired homeward orientation at the Trans sites. Nevertheless, their homeward component was significantly greater than that of the anosmic birds at both geographical areas. This suggests that the Northern Apennine acts as a geographical barrier affecting the olfactory map accuracy of Amino pigeons, rather than totally reducing its spatial extent.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-09-07 09:27:00.000,2019-08-29 22:59:44.000,229857,Columba livia,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

Fifty-two vultures were trapped at the Freeman Ranch in San Marcos, TX using a walk in trap. Trapping occurred between April  1 – April 10, 2013. All 52 vultures received pink patagial wing tags in the patagium of the right wing.  From the group of 52 trapped vultures, six received 70g solar Argos PTT-100 GPS transmitters (four Black Vultures and two Turkey Vultures). All tagged vultures, including the six with transmitters, were released from the tagging site during  the afternoon and evening of April 10, 2013. The deployment-on time is 2:00 AM (CST) on April 11, 2013 to allow for consistency in the data analysis. 
Prior to transmitter deployment, the transmitters were pre-programmed to record 19 Geographical Positioning System (GPS) location fixes per day. The fix times selected were based on the hours of sunrise and sunset in deployment-on location (Freeman Ranch in San Marcos, TX). Sunrise and sunset times for the entire year were considered and the chosen fix times allowed for hourly GPS fixes during the day and then periodic GPS fixes during the night. The need to include gaps in the nighttime fix rate was to conserve transmitter battery power, which operates using solar energy.

The historical range of Geronticus eremita probably extended throughout North Africa and into the Middle East. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the species has been known from two disjunct populations: a western population in Morocco currently estimated at 300 individuals, an eastern migratory population between Syria and Ethiopia (less than 5 individuals) and in Turkey where remain 180 semi-captive birds (“BirdLife International,” 2015).
Between 2004 and 2011 an experimental programme, “Proyecto Eremita”, was accomplished in La Janda (Cádiz, southwestern Spain), to evaluate the efficiency of different releasing techniques of ibises bred in captivity in European zoos (NBI EEP) aimed to establish sedentary populations in this area. The “Proyecto Eremita” was developed by  the regional government of Andalusia (Junta de Andalucía) in collaboration with ZooBotánico Jerez, Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The success of that project encouraged its promoters to undertake the reintroduction program in Andalusia  since 2012.
 
As a result of the “Proyecto Eremita” and the reintroduction program, La Janda has currently a wild population of roughly 80 individuals where a small breeding colony was settled in Vejer de la Frontera (Cádiz) in 2008, reaching the 25 breeding pairs in 2014. Among the next challenges for the team involved are the assessment of population viability, as well as advance the knowledge of the ecology of this rare bird. To this end, from 2014 a GPS tracking of some adults and juvenile birds is being conducted to improve insights into the species' threats and other ecological requirements (Vázquez et al., 2015).",research,true,false,true,false,False,na,2014-07-15 11:03:15.000,2023-03-30 21:00:32.000,8568619,Geronticus eremita,"GPS,Acceleration",jbustamante (Javier Bustamante)

",55.43,-114.82,Phylogeography of the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) across its Canadian breeding range,11,11,11,,,,"We evaluated different hypotheses (i.e. morphology, migratory flyway, and panmictic population) that may explain population genetic structure in Canadian breeding populations of the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). We used three sources of information to evaluate the different hypotheses. First, we used genetic information obtained via feather samples from individuals of the three subspecies (S. a. aurocapilla, S. a. cinereus, S. a. furvior). In addition, quill mites (Acariformes, Syringophilidae) were removed from feathers and a fragment of their COI gene was sequenced to assess their species identity and population structure as possible reflections of host population structuring.  For two Ovenbird subspecies (S. a. aurocapilla and S. a. cinereus) we used light-level geolocators to quantify migratory paths and identify wintering areas. Paleo-hindcast projections from bioclimatic models of Ovenbird distribution were generated to identify potential locations of refugia for this species during the last glacial maximum as a factor explaining population genetic structure. We found relatively strong migratory connectivity within and among two subspecies, but little genetic support for the migratory flyway hypothesis.  Similarly, there was no difference in wing length and body weight between subspecies to support the morphology hypothesis.  Birds breeding in the Cypress Hills (S. a. cinereus) can be considered a distinct genetic unit, but there was no evidence of genetic differentiation or isolation by distance among all other subpopulations, providing most support for the panmictic population hypothesis suggesting that with the exception of those in Cypress Hills, Ovenbirds across Canada form one panmictic population.  There was also very limited genetic variation among the syringophilid mites, indicating that Ovenbird movements can maintain gene flow in symbiont populations.  These results are consistent with predictions from paleo-hindcast distribution models from two different global climate models indicating a continuous single refugium 21,000 years BP (ca. Last Glacial Maximum), with the possibility of a separate refugium for S. a. cinereus vs. other subspecies.  Our results suggest that two of the three Ovenbird subspecies are defined by criteria that can be considered arbitrary and may not provide a strong model for setting population management units.

We tested edge avoidance by forest understory passerines in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and also compared their mobility and movement patterns in contiguous and fragmented landscapes to assess whether movements would increase in the fragmented landscape. Between 2003 and 2005, 96 Chiroxiphia caudata, 38 Pyriglena leucoptera and 27 Sclerurus scansor were radio-tracked. The most strictly forest species C. caudata and S. scansor avoided forest edges, while P. leucoptera showed affinities for the edge. Both sensitive species showed larger mean step length and maximal observed daily distance in the fragmented forest versus the unfragmented forest. P. leucoptera did not show any significant difference. There were no significant differences in proportional daily home range use for any of the three species. Our results suggested that fragmentation and the consequent increase in edge areas do influence movement behavior of sensitive forest understory birds that avoided the use of edges and increased the speed and distance they covered daily. For the most restricted forest species, it would be advisable to protect larger patches of forest instead of many small or medium fragments connected by narrow corridors. However, by comparing our data with that obtained earlier, we concluded that movement behavior of resident birds differs from that of dispersing birds and might not allow to infer functional connectivity or landscape-scale sensitivity to fragmentation; a fact that should be taken into consideration when suggesting conservation strategies.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2003-02-17 21:15:00.000,2005-04-15 13:33:00.000,4953,"Chiroxiphia caudata,Pyriglena leucoptera,Sclerurus scansor",Radio Transmitter,MiriamMelanie (Miriam Hansbauer)

Behav.: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size
dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic
requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes
differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We
therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during
the incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated
weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used
coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition
between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and
ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental
conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt
models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have
slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature.
The different energetic requirements related to the birds’ incubation and chick-provisioning pattern
seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly
productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for
themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage.

PLoS One:
Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling
and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern
rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/
0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and
physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used
in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were
previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study.
Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also
found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding
seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact
of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies
with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS
and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein,
triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1–3 days) showed limited
impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving
seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey.
Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2009-11-14 00:13:35.000,2010-01-27 22:10:36.000,48644,Eudyptes chrysocome,GPS,masello (Masello)

From six Water Pipits Anthus spinoletta having received a GPS-recorder in Uebersyren in 2015, 34 data sets dealing with the usage of an overnight sleeping place within this wintering area could be obtained. They showed that the pipits used a stretch of 8 km in length with a total surface of 0.66 km² inside of reeds. Besides two already known resting places inside the investigated territory, three yet unknown places were detected. The pipits equipped with a GPS-receiver regularly/often changed their roosting place; 32 of 34 sites were located inside the bird reserve „Vallée de la Syre de Moutfort à Roodt/Syre”.////

Abstract study 2: Origin and migration route of Water Pipit Anthus spinoletta wintering in Luxembourg detected by GPS. //
Information dealing with the migration route and the origin of Water Pipits Anthus spinoletta wintering in Luxembourg were obtained by GPS-loggers. From 50 pipits equipped with a PinPoint GPS store-on-board logger, only three data sets could be obtained, one of them covering only a short time. The results of 2015 insinuate that the pipits use different routes for migrating in a south-easterly direction to their breeding grounds and they possibly do not always take the shortest way. Two possible breeding regions seemed to be near Lazins in Italy and near mount Hoher Sarstein in Austria.

The success of either migratory strategy is the result of differential forage selection and predation risk-avoidance. In this dissertation, I examine how multi-scale resource selection by migrant and resident elk (Cervus elaphus) differentially influence demography. I studied the partially migratory Ya Ha Tinda elk population, which winters in the province of Alberta and migrates in summer to Banff National Park. I reviewed population trends from 1970–2005, and found the migrant proportion declined from 95% to 60%. To examine the role of differential forage selection, I built a spatially and temporally-explicit forage model using field and remote sensing data to predict available forage biomass and quality to elk. By selecting intermediate forage biomass in phenologically delayed areas, migrants had 5% higher forage digestibility than residents. Next, I developed a spatially and temporally explicit predation risk model for wolves (Canis lupus), elk’s main predator. Predation risk at the summer range scale was 70% lower for migrants compared to residents. Yet, despite riskier summer ranges, resident elk adopted fine-scale foraging and anti-predator strategies within these ranges to reduce the risk they experienced to only 15% higher than that of migrants. Furthermore, predation risk experienced by migrants during migratory periods was 52% higher than residents. Differences in resource selection translated to demographic differences between strategies in Leslie-matrix models. Bottom-up effects manifested in higher pregnancy rates and female calf weights for migrants. Yet top-down effects of predation by wolves and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were greater for migrants, who experienced lower adult and calf survival. Resident adult and calf survival was higher despite poorer forage because of fine-scale risk-avoidance combined with a behavioural response to live in larger group sizes in summer. The ratio of migrant to resident population growth rates from Leslie-matrix models matched the observed rate of migratory decline from 1970-2005. I conclude that given current conditions, notwithstanding potential density-dependent processes, the proportion of migrants in this population will continue to decline as a result of top-down limitation despite the significant benefits of higher forage quality from migration.

These changes may affect the distribution and migration patterns of marine species throughout the annual cycle. Species distribution models have provided detailed understanding of the responses of terrestrial species to climate changes, often based on observational data; biologging offers the opportunity to extend those models to migratory marine species that occur in marine environments where direct observation is difficult. We used species distribution modelling and tracking data to model past changes in the non-breeding distribution of thick-billed murres Uria lomvia from a colony in Hudson Bay, Canada, between 1982 and 2019. The predicted distribution of murres shifted during fall and winter. The largest shifts have occurred for fall migration, with range shits of 211 km west and 50 km north per decade, compared with a 29 km shift west per decade in winter. Regions of range expansions had larger declines in sea ice cover, smaller increases in sea surface temperature, and larger increases in air temperature than regions where the range was stable or declining. Murres migrate in and out of Hudson Bay as ice forms each fall and melts each spring. Habitat in Hudson Bay has become available later into the fall and earlier in the spring, such that habitat in Hudson Bay was available for 21 d longer in 2019 than in 1982. Clearly, marine climate is altering the distribution and annual cycle of migratory marine species that occur in areas with seasonal ice cover.

All nine harlequins successfully initiated molt migration toward the Pacific coast. Male harlequins departed their breeding areas during the early portions of June through early July (June 3 – July 8). The duration of molt migration from breeding sites to their Pacific coast molting areas ranged from ≤4 to 38 days. Male harlequins tended to utilize rivers as stopover locations during migration. Harlequins migrated through a wide variety of habitats, with a preference for temperate conifer forests. Three individuals also utilized grasslands, deserts, and shrublands during migration. We identified the molting locations of seven male harlequins, which included the western coastline of Vancouver Island (n=5), the Salish Sea/Puget Sound (n=1), and coastal Oregon (n=1). Male harlequins generally remained at or near their molting sites during the winter season. One male was successfully tracked for its complete annual cycle. The male was originally captured and equipped with a satellite transmitter in Yellowstone National Park and the following spring it migrated to a southern British Columbia breeding area, approximately 735 km from its Yellowstone breeding site.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2016-05-20 00:00:00.000,2019-06-17 23:47:24.000,2789,,Argos Doppler Shift,dustinm886 (Dustin Meattey)

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. 

The primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of American Golden-Plovers during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. 

From 2018 to 2022, we equipped 65 American Golden-Plovers at 9 Arctic-breeding locations (Utqiagvik, Prudhoe Bay, Nome, Katakturuk, Bylot Island, Igloolik, Cambridge Bay, East Bay, and Kakwa Wildland Provincial Park) with 4.8 g Pinpoint GPS ARGOS tags (Lotek Wireless).

POBox  33 04 51, 14199 BERLIN, Germany",BUMeyburg@aol.com,,"Summary

Very little is known about the Hobby’s migration and wintering. Only a small number of birds are observed at the well-known bottlenecks such as Gibraltar.  A total of 5,720 Hobbies were ringed in ten European countries between 1909 and 1998, of which 203 (3.5%) were subsequently recovered, although none south of the Sahara Desert.The Hobby has been studied in Berlin and its environs for five decades.
In early August 2008 we started a satellite-tracking project after testing the fitting of dummy transmitters in captivity. The first adult female Hobby (weighing 265 g) which we tracked by satellite has been fitted with a 5g satellite tag near Berlin on 9th August 2008. Dimensions of the transmitter were 24 x 14 x 7.5 mm. This first 5g satellite transmitter fitted to a Hobby delivered astoundingly high numbers of good Argos Doppler fixes.  Altogether, two spring and two autumn migrations, as well as two wintering periods, were recorded which resulted in the following paper:

Meyburg B-U, Howey PW, Meyburg C Fiuczynski, K-D 2011: Two complete migration cycles for an adult Hobby tracked by satellite. British Birds 104: 2–15. 
www.Raptor-Research.de

So far we have marked 17 adult Hobbies with satellite tags during this on-going study, two of them were tracked for seven years.

Primates have to decide when and where to move to meet their food requirements while avoiding predation and competition with conspecifics and other species. However, the many comprehensive studies that have deeply explored behavioral adaptations to ecological changes in primates have mainly focused on primates feeding on unevenly distributed food, such as fruits, a resource considered to affect home ranges use. To examine the theories about the drivers of habitat use, evaluations including the role of social interactions, such as, competition with conspecifics, the presence and movement patterns of predators and the availability and distribution of even food resources in leaf-eating primates are very significant. Therefore, I investigate how home range size and movement behavior (length and directionality of daily travel paths) changes in the endangered red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) monkeys is linked to the distribution of preferred food items and how their movement behaviors are linked to the presence and behavior of other social groups of red colobus, predatory species (i.e., chimpanzees) and other, non-predatory species (i.e. red tails, mangabeys) that they form polyspecific associations with, in Kibale National Park.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2022-12-13 10:00:00.000,2023-04-19 19:00:00.000,937,,GPS,GOLOOBA (MARTIN GOLOOBA)

This is especially true if long-range travels occur within crucial stages of a species’ annual life-cycle. Crested penguins, for example, usually disperse over several hundreds of kilometres after completing the energetically demanding breeding season and in preparation for the costly annual moult. A basic understanding of crested penguins’ pre-moult dispersal is therefore paramount in order to be able to assess factors affecting individual survival. The Fiordland penguin, or Tawaki, the only crested penguin species breeding on the New Zealand mainland, is currently one of the least studied and rarest penguin species in the world. We successfully satellite tracked the pre-moult dispersal of 17 adult Tawaki from a single colony located in the species’ northern breeding distribution. Over the course of 8–10 weeks the penguins travelled up to 2,500 km away from their breeding colony, covering total swimming distances of up to 6,800 km. During outbound travels all penguins headed south-west within a well-defined corridor before branching out towards two general trip destinations. Birds leaving in late November travelled towards the Subtropical Front some 800 km south of Tasmania, whereas penguins that left in December headed further towards the subantarctic front. Using K-select analysis we examined the influence of oceanographic factors on the penguins’ dispersal. Water depth, surface current velocity and sea level anomalies had the greatest influence on penguin movements at the subantarctic Front, while sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were key for birds travelling to the subtropical front. We discuss our findings in the light of anthropogenic activities (or lack thereof) in the regions visited by the penguins as well as the potential consequences of Tawaki pre-moult dispersal for the species’ breeding distribution on the New Zealand mainland.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2016-11-10 16:22:59.000,2017-02-12 02:56:30.000,3774,Eudyptes pachyrhynchus,Argos Doppler Shift,tomm (Thomas Mattern)

This population of snow geese have traditionally used very discrete estuary and agricultural habitats associated with Skagit and Port Susan Bays.

The breeding grounds of this population are on Wrangel Island, Russia. Because Wrangel Island snow geese represent the last major snow goose population breeding in Asia, and the primary Russian goose population that winters in North America, it is a high priority for the Pacific Flyway and the subject of long standing international cooperative management and conservation. Data collected since the early 1970s on Wrangel Island indicates that the population has grown in abundance, become younger, and changed its behavior relative to traditional habitat and resources. These population changes have become more apparent since the early 1990s and appear to be in response to warmer spring conditions, earlier snowmelt, and changes in the predator community on Wrangel Island. Some of these changes are also evident in the NPS wintering population where the total overwintering population size has increased.

The objectives of this project are to examine the current relationship of the NPS population to other Pacific flyway use areas. This will include documentation of migration routes, phenology, staging areas, and stopover locations throughout the flyway. Particular questions that we hope to answer include: <br>

- When do geese depart and return to NPS during spring and fall migration?
<br>
- Where are important flyway use areas during migration?
<br>
- When and how long do geese use areas along migration routes?
<br>
- Document inter and/or intra-year interchange among NPS and other wintering areas.
<br>
- Do some geese that use NPS move to other locations within the flyway during the same winter or among different years?
<br>
- If NPS geese are moving to other locations, what is the timing of emigration and potential return to NPS?
<br>
The transmitters are programmed to transmit for three years.

Major movements (>5 km per time period) were almost exclusively at night and were undertaken with and without moonlight. Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle.

2011 was key for marine protection in Portugal, as the Berlengas SPA was enlarged to include a significant proportion of its marine area.Decided to define and implement a legally-binding management plan with clear and measurable actions and targets, the Portuguese Government and SPEA (BirdLife International in Portugal), together with other partners, have
decided to join forces.
The Berlengas archipelago represents an unique opportunity to integrate seabird conservation with the sustainable use of one of Portugal's hottest tourist destinations.
Despite its vicinity to Peniche and the central Portuguese coastline, an area well known for beach based tourism and extreme sports such as kite surfing, diving and surf, the seabird populations of Berlengas are poorly known.
LIFE Berlengas main objectives are:
1-Understand the main threats affecting seabird populations and endemic plant species on land and at
sea (for seabirds) and define actions to minimise/eradicate them, including a long-term monitoring
scheme
2- Promote a sustainable use of the recently created Berlengas SPA, focusing on its main three
economic activities: Fisheries, Recreational activities and Tourism
3- Define the necessary monitoring framework for the completion and approval of the management
plan of Berlengas SPA.
Berlengas archipelago is the stronghold of the Shag breeding population in Portugal, with more than 60% of
the national population (Equipa Atlas 2008). The last survey conducted in 2012 revealed 82 pairs
concentrated mostly on Berlenga island and, compared with previous censuses, a decrease of ca. 10% was
observed (Lecoq et al. 2012).Data-logger devices will be placed for monitoring of seabird species nesting in Berlengas archipelago (Cory’s
shearwater, Madeiran storm-petrel, Yellow-legged gull and Shag). Devices will be selected in accordance with
the target species.

The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is a vulnerable mammal that presents low capacity for physiological thermoregulation and uses forests as thermal shelters. Here, we aim to provide reliable estimates of giant anteaters’ movement patterns and home range size, as well as untangle the role of intrinsic and environmental drivers on their movement. We GPS-tracked 19 giant anteaters in Brazilian savannah. We used a continuous-time movement model to estimate their movement patterns (described by home range crossing time, daily distance moved and directionality), and provide an autocorrelated kernel density estimate of home range size. Then, we used mixed structural equations to integratively model the effects of sex, body mass and proportion of forest cover on movement patterns and home range size, considering the complex net of interactions between these variables. Male giant anteaters presented more intensive space use and larger home range than females with similar body mass, as it is expected in polygynous social mating systems. Males and females increased home range size with increasing body mass, but the allometric scaling of intensity of space use was negative for males and positive for females, indicating different strategies in search for resources. With decreasing proportion of forest cover inside their home ranges, and, consequently, decreasing thermal quality of their habitat, giant anteaters increased home range size, possibly to maximize the chances of accessing thermal shelters. As frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and deforestation are increasing, effective management efforts need to consider the role of forests as an important thermal resource driving spatial requirements of this species. We highlight that both intrinsic and environmental drivers of animal movement should be integrated to better guide management strategies.

For the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), we aim to assess environmental habitat selection drivers, priority areas for conservation and overlap with vessel traffic off northern Chilean Patagonia (NCP). For this, we implemented a single-step continuous-time correlated-random-walk model which accommodates observational error and movement parameters variation in relation to oceanographic variables. Spatially explicit predictions of whales’ behavioral responses were combined with density predictions from previous species distribution models (SDM) and vessel tracking data to estimate the relative probability of vessels encountering whales and identifying areas where interaction is likely to occur. These estimations were conducted independently for the aquaculture, transport, artisanal fishery, and industrial fishery fleets operating in NCP. Blue whale movement patterns strongly agreed with SDM results, reinforcing our knowledge regarding oceanographic habitat selection drivers. By combining movement and density modeling approaches we provide a stronger support for purported priority areas for blue whale conservation and how they overlap with the main vessel traffic corridor in the NCP. The aquaculture fleet was one order of magnitude larger than any other fleet, indicating it could play a decisive role in modulating potential negative vessel-whale interactions within NCP.

doubled its wintering numbers in a C. fluminea invaded estuary where they
actively feed upon this invasive clam. Given that, the facilitative interaction
between the invasive C. fluminea and the migratory Eurasian oystercatcher
seems to respond to bottom-up forces. Altogether, our results suggest that

undeveloped open-dry habitats in response to snowfall or high summer temperatures.

Aim: To study local and long-range movements of Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus), and investigate
the influence of environmental variables on spatial and temporal distributions of the species on a large
scale.

Methods: We use 4-year-long location data from 6 juvenile Cinereous Vultures fitted with satellite-received
transmitters to track their movements and obtain habitat suitability models.

Results: A few months after fledging, Cinereous Vultures may migrate from the Caucasus as far south as the
Arabian Peninsula. Their movements are concentrated in undeveloped open-dry habitats. High
temperatures push the vultures to higher latitudes and altitudes, while reverse seasonal movements are
triggered by the extent of snow cover.

Conclusions: Our study shows the importance of the Arabian Peninsula and Iran as wintering areas for
Cinereous Vultures. Long-distance movements by immature cinereous vultures are determined by climate
seasonality, and in light of climate-warming scenarios for the next 100 years, there might be a shift in
timing of the onset of the species seasonal movements and a change in the duration and geography of
its wintering and summering.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2003-12-28 00:00:00.000,2010-12-26 00:00:00.000,3555,Aegypius monachus,Radio Transmitter,Lexo (Alexander Gavashelishvili)

Specifically, we tested parameters that represent differences in movement strategies and efficiencies such as speed, distance and straightness in an overall, daily and hourly scale. Our preliminary analysis have revealed the effect of season on the migratory strategies and a combined diurnal and nocturnal migration flight strategy. Geographical challenges such as desert and sea barriers and unforeseen meteorological conditions may affect flight behaviour. We hypothesize that among lesser kestrel there is a strategic trade-off in migratory behaviour, from a broad-spectrum strategy which varies from energy-maximizers to time-minimizers and that is dependant upon ecological conditions.

This study reports the near-real time monitoring of fine-scale behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) video-recorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced
by analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by
the tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the
distribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant
simulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (r s = 0.184, p=0.001).
The model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current
flow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator’s
fine-scale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014.",research,true,true,false,false,False,na,2014-05-05 14:30:00.000,2014-05-18 14:32:00.000,1140,Mola mola,GPS,llsousa (Lara Sousa)

Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) are long-distance migratory shorebirds with a Holarctic breeding distribution and recent studies have documented population-specific migrations that vary in duration (short to long) and frequency of stops (none/few to multiple). Factors driving these population-specific differences are unclear. We studied the migration ecology of Whimbrels breeding in Alaska, USA, using satellite transmitters deployed from 2006 to 2010 and tracked through 2015. Whimbrels moved entirely within the Pacific Americas Flyway, and some conducted nonstop flights that exceeded 7 days across ~8700 km. Birds dispersed across numerous sites throughout the flyway, often using agriculture or aquaculture habitats.  Whimbrels generally exhibited fidelity to breeding and nonbreeding sites, but typically only exhibited fidelity to staging sites used prior to long, nonstop migratory flights. Alaska-breeding Whimbrels exhibited high variation in migratory behaviors which we attributed to the extensive breadth of nonbreeding distributions (~70° latitude across ~8600 km), a range that naturally shaped individual responses to unequal migratory demands.

We mapped migration from breeding through winter of one of the smallest Afro-Palearctic migrants, the willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, using geolocators (n = 15). Birds migrated from North European breeding grounds to West Africa via the Iberian Peninsula following a narrow corridor along the West Coast of Africa. Birds then dispersed across the northern Savannah with termination of migration highly variable among individuals. The termination of migration appeared not to be related to timing, current and previous years’ vegetation conditions or biometrics. During winter, most birds moved southwards to improved vegetation. The willow warblers showed a large, unexpected longitudinal spread in winter sites of more than 3000 km between individuals breeding within a 500 m range resulting in a low degree of connectivity. The large wintering area may well be related to generalist behaviour in the species.

This foraging strategy makes the penguins particularly susceptible to set net operations that go after dogfish or school shark at the seafloor. Yellow-eyed penguin numbers are currently in free fall all along the mainland with climate change and fisheries interactions being suspected to play an important role in the current trends. However, the accurate assessment of fisheries impacts is hampered by a lack of data of the penguins’ utilization of the marine habitat. While some tracking work has been conducted in the past few years, our understanding of the penguins’ foraging ranges throughout the year is extremely limited. In some regions, we have no idea where the penguins go to find food and whether their home ranges overlap with commercial set net fisheries.

We propose to fit Microwave Telemetry 70 gram GSM/GPS transmitters to 50-55 day old chicks (pre-fledging age). The eagles are fitted with a transmitter using a backpack style harness and returned to the nest within1 hour. We have used this method in previous studies and were able to provide data on local movements of eagles for the US Army, US Navy, and USFWS Chesapeake Bay Field Office. The young eagles utilize similar foraging areas as their parents within the natal territory.  After the chicks fledge the nest they typically stay in the natal territory for 1 to 8 months before dispersing (n = 19, Mojica unpub. data).      

Data from the transmitter will be monitored once a week to check on the status of the eagle(s). Data will be stored online in a free but secure cloud service provided by Movebank.org. Navy personnel will be given an account to access the data and set up daily or weekly email alerts.

The Tandem Research Group will be led by the PI, hosted at the Ecology Department of the Biosciences Institute of the University of São Paulo (IBUSP), in partnership with the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (MPIAB, PI: Prof. Dr. Martin Wikelski). Associated researchers include Prof. Dr. Kamran Safi and Prof. Dr. Carlos David Santos (MPIO), and Prof. Dr. Paulo Inácio Prado (IBUSP).

Abstract
Using new bio-logging technology, researchers can now answer questions about the behavior, ecology and physiology of wild animals, particularly for wide-ranging or cryptic species, which have previously evaded examination. Many of these research questions are now investigated in the expanding field of Movement Ecology. Conservation scientists and practitioners are increasingly relying on movement ecology studies aid in understanding the threats and causes of population declines. This proposal describes a research program in Movement Ecology and Conservation that will explore the ecology and conservation of birds in the Caatinga biome in Brazil. The endemic and globally endangered Lear’s macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) and four New-World vulture species will serve as models to address questions related to (1) the fundamental ecology of long-lived and wide-ranging avian frugivores and scavengers, (2) their ecosystem services, (3) human-wildlife conflicts, and (4) conservation planning based on Movement Ecology. The research program also aims to foster the development of the discipline of Movement Ecology in Brazil though mentoring of students, teaching of a graduate-level course at the host institution, and organizing of an academic symposium and workshops. We will disseminate the research results to multiple audiences through an outreach website, and participation in radio and in-person events focused on the rural communities in the study area.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2022-08-30 16:00:47.000,2023-09-14 18:01:09.000,4388411,"Cathartes aura,Cathartes burrovianus,Coragyps atratus,Sarcoramphus papa","GPS,Acceleration,Magnetometer,Orientation",fvdenes (Francisco Voeroes Dénes)

Tracking data is particularly powerful when combined with oceanographic information derived from satellite remote sensing, allowing insights into the functional mechanisms of marine ecosystems. While this framework has been used extensively over the last two decades, there are still vast ocean regions and many seabird species for which information is scarce, particularly in tropical oceans. 
Methods: In this study we tracked the movement at high GPS recording frequency of 15 White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) during chick-rearing from a colony in Fernando de Noronha (offshore of Northeast Brazil). Flight behaviours of travelling and searching for food were derived from GPS data and examined in relation to satellite-sensed oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration). 
Results: White-tailed Tropicbirds showed marked preference for clear and warm sea surface waters, which are indicative of low primary productivity but are likely the best habitat for preying upon flying fish. 
Discussion: These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that foraging habitat choices of tropical seabirds may not be driven by primary productivity, as has been widely shown for non-tropical species.

To improve our knowledge of this species, Batumi Raptor Count has teamed up with traditional falconers that primarily trap Eurasian Sparrowhawk (A. nisus) for quail-hunting and competitive falconry, and who occasionally trap Levant Sparrowhawk (A. brevipes as well). In autumn 2022 & 2023 we aim to trap and tag 8 Levant Sparrowhawks, preferentially adult females, with 4.5g HQXSN tags this project to deliver new data on the species' migration and non-breeding movements. 

Regarding migration, we are particularly interested in quantifying nocturnal and diurnal flight activity of Levant Sparrowhawks, identifying gpotential stop-over hot-spots and other areas of conservation concern, and determining the breeding areas of Levant Sparrowhawks migrating along the eastern Black Sea flyway in autumn. Ideally, we hope to track several birds over multiple years to study how consistent these birds are in terms of individual route choice through the Caucasus, and further along their flyway.

By making the migrations of these small hawks visible we further hope to foster greater appreciation for this species among falconers. Levant Sparrowhawks have long been considered ‘bad hawks’ by falconers, because their migratory instinct is too strong for them to be trained for quail hunting. When a Levant Sparrowhawk does end up in the net, some falconers will kill them to feed their Eurasian Sparrowhawks. Just across the border, however, in NE Turkey, falconers stopped killing Levant Sparrowhawks and other by-catch years ago, after they were introduced to cheap alternative feeding techniques during an education campaign by WWF Turkey. We will combine outreach about the hawks’ migrations with practical information for Georgian falconers to reduce their dependency on wild bird meat, thus steering Georgia's migration-based falconry tradition in a more sustainable direction.

A major threat to the survival of the African wild dog is the loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats. As a result, wild dogs are forced to live in isolated and small subpopulations, which are particularly vulnerable to extinction. Through emigration and immigration, dispersing individuals lead to the formation of new groups, can rescue small subpopulations, and recolonize unoccupied areas. Understanding how and where wild dogs disperse, and assessing connectivity between subpopulations is thus fundamental for the management and conservation of the species across large wildlife landscapes. One such example is the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA/TFCA), for which wild dogs have been identified as a flagship and umbrella species. Mainly due to technological limitations, however, information on wild dog dispersal is lacking and the fate of dispersers largely unknown. 
Here, we propose to deploy state-of-the-art GPS/Satellite collars on dispersing wild dogs inhabiting northern Botswana to collect information on dispersal movement patterns (e.g. travelled distance, habitat use during dispersal, barrier to movements) and dispersal success (e.g. survival rate during dispersal, breeding success in newly established packs), and to evaluate connectivity across different habitats and landscapes. Finally, we will merge information on dispersing individuals with existing data on resident packs to create a demographic model and assess population extinction risks and viability under changing environmental and anthropogenic scenarios. Results from this project will be used to guide effective management plans to conserve this highly endangered and charismatic species. 
The goal of the proposed project is to improve the long-term viability and connectivity of African wild dog subpopulations nationally and across the greater Kavango-Zambesi (KAZA/TFCA) by providing new empirical evidence and novel information on dispersal and its demographic consequences. Our project will allow assessing population viability and extinction risks under changing environmental and anthropogenic scenarios and thus help identifying key conservation actions.

Although chimpanzees and humans share many of the same cognitive abilities, how they compare in solving spatial tasks is unclear to date. Therefore this study conducted a human physical simulation method that resembles foraging patterns of chimpanzees to enable comparing these spatiotemporal cognitive abilities. Furthermore, this study aimed to interpret animal movement and spatiotemporal cognitive abilities by relating revisit intervals to cognitive processes such as learning and memory. For this, two variables, constancy and contingency, have been used to reflect search efficiency, and their values were used to make inferences about the cognitive abilities of humans and chimpanzees. Ultimately, this study investigated how the average patterns in revisit constancy and contingency relate to the spatiotemporal cognitive abilities of chimpanzees, and how this compares to those of humans. These results are highly valuable in addressing the aforementioned existing knowledge gaps, but the novel stimulation method additionally provides a great perspective for future research into animal movement.

Furthermore, migratory connectivity – the connections made by migrating individuals between networks of breeding and non-breeding sites – has important implications for population dynamics. The Whinchat Saxicola rubetra is declining across its range, and tracking data from a single African non-breeding site implies high migratory spread. Here, we use geolocators to describe the migration routes and non-breeding areas of 20 Whinchats from three British breeding populations. As expected, migratory spread was high, with birds from the three populations overlapping across a wide area of West Africa. On average, in non-breeding areas British Whinchats were located 652 km apart from one another, with some likely to share non-breeding areas with individuals from breeding populations as far east as Russia. Four males made a direct non-breeding season movement to a second, more westerly, non-breeding location in January. Autumn migration was through Iberia and around the western edge of the Sahara Desert, whereas spring migration was more direct, indicating an anti-clockwise loop migration. Weak migratory connectivity implies that Whinchat populations are somewhat buffered against local changes in non-breeding conditions. If non-breeding season processes have played a role in the species’ decline, then large-scale drivers are likely to be the cause, though processes operating on migration, or interactions between breeding and non-breeding processes, cannot be ruled out.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2016-06-19 00:04:00.000,2018-06-18 12:26:38.000,13056,Saxicola rubetra,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw",malcburgess (Malcolm Burgess)

Utilization distributions have become one of the most common ways to quantify space use and have advanced our knowledge of animal ecology in a variety of ways. However, until recently, they were limited to two dimensions (2D), despite the fact that a majority of taxa use their environments in all three spatial dimensions (3D). In this study we: 1) demonstrate the creation of 3D utilization distributions via a multivariate kernel density estimator, 2) adapt two joint space use indices for use with 3D data, and 3) assess these methods using data from American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) during their non-breeding season in Jamaica. We found that, compared to 3D methods, 2D methods overestimated individual (pairwise) spatial overlap by 3% in scrub habitat and 4% in mangrove habitat. Similarly, 2D methods overestimated total (all neighbors combined) spatial overlap by 9% in scrub and 12% in mangrove habitat. Using joint space use indices, we also found that American Redstarts avoided areas of overlap to some degree, possibly to limit agonistic interactions with neighbors. Although 3D methods require larger sample sizes (80-110 locations) than 2D (40-70 locations), we argue that modeling animal space use in 3D is more realistic and will enhance understanding of niche differentiation, inter- and intra-specific competition, habitat selection and use, and wildlife conservation.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,0011-03-01 05:00:00.000,0012-03-01 05:00:00.000,3614,Setophaga ruticilla,GPS,nathanwands (Nathan Cooper)

This study is the first to present data on the migratory movements of the “large-billed” subspecies, F. a. naumanni, that breeds in the high Arctic and which has significantly larger body size than those farther south.  During 2013–2015, migration tracks were collected from nine adult puffins (6 males and 3 females) tagged with geolocators in northwest Greenland.  Overall, female puffins traveled farther than males on their annual migration, with one female puffin traveling over 13,600 km, which was nearly a third farther than any tagged male in our study.  Differential migration was observed in migratory phenology and route, with males using a form of chain migration with acute synchrony between individuals while females appeared to largely use leap-frog migration and showed little synchrony between individuals.  Extreme sexual segregation in wintering areas was evidenced by two females that migrated to the southern limit of the species range while the six males remained at the northern limit, and wintered along the sea ice edge during portions of the non-breeding season.  Male puffins thus wintered in regions with sea surface temperatures up to 10° C cooler than female puffins, and in areas with generally colder sea surface temperatures when compared to previously known wintering areas of temperate and low Arctic puffin breeding populations.  The degree to which body size enables male F. a. naumanni to remain in colder waters likely reflects differing life history constraints between sexes and populations (i.e., subspecies).  Further study is warranted to investigate how recent changes in climate have further exacerbated the observed differences between sexes in high Arctic puffins and possibly other marine avian species.

The eagles left their breeding area in mid- to late October and migrated to known wintering areas in the eastern United States. In spring 1993, satellite telemetry located the eagles in their former breeding territory in late March, mid-April and early May. This study confirms previous suggestion that some breeding Golden Eagles wintering in eastern United States come from northern Quebec and describes the first successful tracking of the complete yearly migration cycle of a bird of prey.

This study is the first to provide data on summer and winter ranges and migration distances. We highlight a behaviour previously unknown in Gyrfalcons, in which birds winter on sea ice far from land. During 2000–2004, data were collected from 48 Gyrfalcons tagged with satellite transmitters in three parts of Greenland: Thule (northwest), Kangerlussuaq (central-west) and Scoresbysund (central-east). Breeding home-range size for seven adult females varied from 140 to 1197 km2 and was 489 and 503 km2 for two adult males. Complete outward migrations from breeding to wintering areas were recorded for three individuals: an adult male which travelled 3137 km over a 38-day period (83 km⁄day) from northern Ellesmere Island to southern Greenland, an adult female which travelled 4234 km from Thule to southern Greenland (via eastern Canada) over an 83-day period (51 km⁄day), and an adult female which travelled 391 km from Kangerlussuaq to southern Greenland over a 13-day period (30 km ⁄ day). Significant differences were found in winter home-range size between Falcons tagged on the west coast (383–6657 km2) and east coast (26 810– 63 647 km2). Several Falcons had no obvious winter home-ranges and travelled continually during the non-breeding period, at times spending up to 40 consecutive days at sea, presumably resting on icebergs and feeding on seabirds. During the winter, one juvenile female travelled over 4548 km over an approximately 200-day period, spending over half that time over the ocean between Greenland and Iceland. These are some of the largest winter home-ranges ever documented in raptors and provide the first documentation of the long-term use of pelagic habitats by any falcon. In general, return migrations were faster than outward ones.

Large gulls (genus Larus) for example are mainly acting as generalist predators in the Arctic and hence interact with most other vertebrates. However, among the six large arctic gull taxa, including three long-distance migrants, to date none have been intensively studied.

To document the flyways and migratory behaviour of the Vega gull, a widespread but poorly known Siberian migrant, we monitored 28 individuals with GPS loggers over a mean period of 383 days.
Birds used similar routes in spring and autumn, preferring coastal to inland or offshore routes, and travelled 4000-5500km between their breeding (Siberia) and wintering grounds (mainly Republic of Korea and Japan). 

Spring migration mainly occurred in May and was twice as fast and more synchronized among individuals than autumn migration. Active mMigration bouts mainly occurred during day and twilight, but rates of travel were always higher during the few night flights. Flight altitudes were nearly always higher during active migration bouts than during other bouts, and lower during twilight. Altitudes >2000m were recorded during migrations, when birds made non-stop inland flights above mountain ranges and the vast boreal forest. Individuals showed high inter-annual consistency in their movements in winter and summer, indicating site-faithfulness to their breeding and wintering sites. Within-individual variation was similar in spring and autumn, but between individual variation was higher in autumn than in spring.

Compared with previous studies, our results suggest that the timing of spring migration in large arctic gulls is likely constrained by snow melt on breeding ground, while the duration of migration windows could be related to the proportion of inland versus coastal habitats found along their flyways (‘fly-and-forage’ strategy). Ongoing environmental changes could hence possibly impact the timing, but not the duration, of their migration in the future.

Green St., Athens, Georgia 30602, USA",mchamberlain@warnell.uga.edu,,"Coyotes (Canis latrans) are a highly adaptable canid species whose behavioral plasticity has allowed them to persist in a wide array of habitats throughout North America. As generalists, coyotes can alter movement patterns and change territorial strategies between residency (high site fidelity) and transiency (low site fidelity) to maximize fitness. Uncertainty remains about resident and transient coyote movement patterns and habitat use because research has reached conflicting conclusions regarding patterns of habitat use by both groups.  We quantified effects of habitat on resident and transient coyote movement behavior using first passage time (FPT) analysis, which assesses recursive movement along an individual’s movement path to delineate where they exhibit area-restricted search (ARS) behaviors relative to habitat attributes. We quantified monthly movement rates for 171 coyotes (76 residents, 53 transients) and then used estimated FPT values in generalized linear mixed models to quantify monthly habitat use for resident and transient coyotes. Transients had greater movement rates than residents across all months except January. Resident FPT values were positively correlated with agricultural landcover during fall and winter, but negatively correlated with agriculture during spring. Resident FPT values were also negatively correlated with developed habitats during May–August, deciduous landcover during June–August, and wetlands from September–January except November. FPT values of transient coyotes were positively correlated with developed areas throughout much of the year and near wetlands during July–September. Transient FPT values were negatively correlated with agriculture during all months except June and July. High FPT values (ARS behavior) of residents and transients were generally correlated with greater densities of edge habitat. Although we observed high individual variation in space use, our study found substantive differences in habitat use between residents and transients, providing further evidence that complexity and plasticity of coyote habitat use is influenced by territorial strategy.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,GPS,swebster (Sarah Webster)

This opens up the opportunity to study how migration develops within individuals in consecutive years and the extent to which the migratory program is constrained. Such knowledge is essential for understanding the degree of individual flexibility during the annual cycle, which may help identifying potential bottlenecks, where the range of individual decisions is restricted. In this study, we investigate repeatability in time of a long-distance migratory songbird, the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio, tracked across consecutive years (n = 7). Furthermore, we explore the population variability and dependencies between consecutive events of departure and arrival throughout the annual cycle in this species (n = 15). We find that individuals show high repeatability in timing of departure from their two main non-breeding areas in sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, low repeatability is found in timing of arrivals to stationary sites throughout the annual cycle. Population variation in timing of departure and arrival was similar across all events, ranging from 30 to 41 days, and was highly dependent on timing of preceding events. We conclude that timing of departures is the key event potentially controlled by the individual innate migration program, while arrivals are more flexible, likely dependent on the environmental conditions experienced en route in red-backed shrikes. Still, apparent flexibility in the individual schedule may be hampered by overall constraints of the annual cycle.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-06-24 20:35:00.000,2016-02-29 17:21:00.000,12115,Lanius collurio,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw",lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)

In many cases, birds do not migrate strait from breeding to non-breeding areas but fly via a detour. All western European populations of red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio are assumed to reach their southern African wintering grounds detouring via southeast Europe. Based on theoretical considerations under an optimality framework this detour is apparently optimal. Here, we use individual geolocator data on red-backed shrikes breeding in Spain to show that these birds do indeed detour via southeast Europe en route to southern Africa where they join other European populations of red-backed shrikes and return via a similar route in spring. Disregarding potential wind assistance, the routes taken for the tracked birds in autumn were not optimal compared to crossing the barrier directly. For spring migration the situation was quite different with the detour apparently being optimal. However, when considering potential wind assistance estimated total air distances during autumn migration were overall similar and the barrier crossing shorter along the observed routes. We conclude that considering the potential benefit of wind assistance makes the route via southeast Europe likely to be less risky in autumn. However, it cannot be ruled out that other factors, such as following a historical colonisation route could still be important.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2011-06-29 20:30:00.000,2014-07-04 04:25:00.000,4403,Lanius collurio,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw",lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)

Whereas the former shows a great degree of specialization in prey and habitat selection, the later is considered a broad generalist. Thus, we selected two study areas with differences habitats in order to tag lesser and common kestrels and compare their movements, hunting strategies, energy expenditure, prey and habitat selection. We used high temporal and spatial resolution bio-loggers. So far, three papers have been published using these data: 1) Sarè et al. (2019).

Penguins’ foraging activity was repeatable despite varying annual sea-ice conditions. Birds’ site fidelity is constrained by both sea-ice conditions around the colony that limit movements and resources availability, and also behavioural repeatability of individuals driven by phenological constraints. Adélie penguins favoured sea-ice concentrations between 20-30%, as these facilitate access to open water while opening multiple patches for exploration in restricted areas in case of prey depletion. When the sea-ice concentration became greater than 30%, foraging site fidelity decreased and showed higher variability, while it increased again after 60%. Between two trips, the foraging site fidelity remained high when sea-ice concentration changed by ± 10% but showed greater variability when sea-ice concentrations differed on a larger range.

solar-powered GPS-GSM units, manufactured by Cellular Tracking Technologies,
Inc.) on seventeen adult Bald Eagles from 2013 to 2015 in Maine.
Trapping sites at inland lake sites were selected based on nest location records for
the entire state as provided by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and
Wildlife (MDIFW). These data were used to select and confirm active nest sites
based on their utility for the study and finalized through consultations with
MDIFW. At these inland lake sites, nests are generally associated with
super-dominant trees and negatively associated with distance to the lake shore,
areas of timber harvest, and overall anthropogenic disturbance. Initial efforts 
to deploy transmitters in the fall of 2013 and winter of 2014
resulted in two transmitters being deployed close to the Rollins wind energy facility
and one transmitter being deployed adjacent to the Bull Hill facility in Penobscot
County near the town of Lincoln. The primary eagle trapping efforts occurred in the
summer of 2015 when fifteen transmitters were deployed across the state. We
caught the eagles using floating fish snares at inland lakes and 
ponds, we collected small blood samples (≈ 2 cc) to conduct DNA sex tests. All
Bald Eagles were handled in accordance with the University of Massachusetts
Amherst Animal Care and Use Protocol 2012-0068 and USGS Bird Banding Lab
Permit 23140.

The telemetry units (< 3% of body weight, per BBL standards) collected data
on location (WGS84, ± 18 m), elevation above sea level (± 22 m), speed (± 1 kts),
and flight direction (± 1°) and was transmitted over the Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) network to data servers. The
transmitters were programmed to determine their geographic position and adjust
their duty cycle to record data every 15 minutes from one hour before sunrise to one
hour after sunset. We filtered out poor-quality GPS positional data (i.e., 2D fixes or
altitude above ground level of ≤ 0 m) which accounted for < 1% of our overall data

It is alleged that leopards fail to settle where they are translocated to, owing to territoriality. We address the need to publish more accounts of successful repatriation of leopards, but also include novel applications aimed at orphans and confiscated leopards. (2) We satellite collared 16 leopards which included a mixture of relocated, and translocated leopards, of which the latter included conventional Damage Causing Animals (DCAs, viz 'problem animals'), orphans and confiscations. We determined standard home- range metrics and assessed home-range stabilisation as a means of determining site fidelity. Premature mortality and site infidelity, i.e homing back to origins, were considered failures. We looked at range stabilisation by examining successive monthly ranges against that of the preceeding month, i.e UDOIs. (3) Relocations turned out to be residents (~3 km, n=3), while they were immune to intervention, while translocations resulted in 50% success (n=12), which were invariably confiscated adults of unknown origin, and simulations of natal dispersals of orphans (~25 km, n =3). DCAs never settled where released (~90 km, n = 5). Resident leopards showed high monthly UDOIs, and for those translocated, a minimum of 0.15 was benchmarked to suggest range stability, which also reflected large spatial ranging. (4) Success in HR establishment was associated with landscapes which were unsaturated by other leopards, but anthropogenic threats still persisted, such that survival after a year was ~45%, but was not different to the normal background mortality of areas outside protected areas in the country.

Here, we describe the foraging movements of yelkouan shearwater Puffinus yelkouan, a seabird endemic to the Mediterranean Sea that spends its entire life cycle within this enclosed basin and whose future conservation is intimately linked to human-driven and climatic changes affecting the sea. The aim was to understand the main factors underlying the choice of foraging locations during the reproductive phases. A total of 34 foraging trips were obtained from 21 breeding adults tagged and tracked on Tavolara Archipelago (N Sardinia, Italy). This is the largest and most important breeding area for the species, accounting for more than 50% of the world population. The relationships between foraging movements during two different breeding stages and the seasonal changes of primary productivity at sea were modeled. Movements appeared to be addressed toward inshore (<20 km), highly productive, and relatively shallow (<200 m) foraging areas, often in front of river mouths and at great distances from the colony. During incubation, the Bonifacio Strait and other coastal areas close to North and West Sardinia were the most preferred locations (up to 247 km from the colony). During the chick-rearing phase, some individuals reached areas placed at greater distances from the colony (up to 579 km), aiming at food-rich hotspots placed as far north as the Gulf of Lion (France). The need for such long distance and long-lasting foraging trips is hypothesized to be related to unfavorable conditions on the less productive (and already depleted) Sardinian waters.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2011-04-03 05:06:00.000,2015-04-21 21:20:00.000,10649,Puffinus yelkouan,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

We studied the annual migration schedules of European nightjar, a large nocturnal insectivore and compared it with two other larger migratory insectivores, common swift and common cuckoo. All species breed in North Europe and winter in sub-Saharan Africa, but estimating their spatiotemporal non-breeding distributions from observations is complicated by the occurrence of similar local African species. We used geolocators to track the annual migrations of nightjars and swifts and compared these with satellite tracking of cuckoo migration.

Individuals of the three species migrated to wintering grounds centered in Central Africa, except some common swifts that remained in West Africa, crossing or circumventing the Sahara along different routes in spring and fall. Overall, all species showed similar regional and seasonal use of several stopover areas during migration. Among the three species, European nightjars and common cuckoos showed the most similar spatiotemporal migration patterns. The nightjars wintered in SW Central Africa and breeding and wintering made up by far the two longest stationary periods. Swifts were generally more mobile, and some individuals progressively visited areas further east in East Africa during winter and further west in West Africa on spring migration; this species also spent less time on stopovers, but more on wintering areas. Cuckoos were intermediate in their extent of movements. The speed of nightjar spring migration was equal to that of fall migration, in contrast to the two other species where spring return to breeding areas was faster.

Yet, recent studies highlight that so-called green energy, such as wind energy, may come at environmental costs, for example when wind turbines kill birds and bats. Using miniaturized GPS loggers, we studied how an open-space foraging bat with high collision risk with wind turbines, the common noctule Nyctalus noctula (Schreber, 1774), interacts with wind turbines. We compared actual flight trajectories to correlated random walks to identify habitat variables explaining the movements of bats. Both sexes preferred wetlands but used conventionally managed cropland less than expected based on availability. During midsummer, females traversed the land on relatively long flight paths and repeatedly came close to wind turbines. Their flight heights above ground suggested a high risk of colliding with wind turbines. In contrast, males recorded in early summer commuted straight between roosts and foraging areas and overall flew lower than the operating range of most turbine blades, suggesting a lower collision risk. Flight heights of bats suggest that during summer the risk of collision with wind turbines was high for most studied bats at the majority of currently installed wind turbines. For siting of wind parks, preferred bat habitats and commuting routes should be identified and avoided.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2014-09-06 20:18:40.000,2015-12-05 02:32:47.000,4442,Nyctalus noctula,"GPS,Acceleration",manuelroeleke (Manuel Roeleke)

The tracking of resident or short-distance migrants animals remains however challenging because geolocation errors are substantial and difficult to estimate. This study aims to examine the sex-specific marine space uses of a resident tropical seabird, the masked booby (Sula dactylatra), during its full annual life cycle at the Fernando de Noronha archipelago (Brazil). Masked boobies (n = 31) tagged with GLS recording light intensity, seawater immersion, and water temperature showed a resident behaviour over their entire annual cycle. A wavelet analysis of GLS data revealed oscillatory patterns of inferred longitude correlated with changes in immersion frequency. This synchronicity demonstrated that birds traveled away and back from the colony on consecutive trips of short length (~ 2-4 days) and short range (~ 100-300 km) from the east of the colony. Duration and range of trips depended on the sex of the individual and on the time of the year. Trip duration increased gradually from the end of the breeding period to the post-breeding period, probably due to the release of the central-place breeding constraints. During the pre-breeding period, females had farther ranges eastward and spent more time in water than males. Despite inherent limits of light-based geolocation, this study demonstrates the relevance of synchronicity analysis of GLS data for investigating resident or short-distance migrants year-round movements.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,Sula dactylatra,Solar Geolocator,SophieLB (Sophie Lanco-Bertrand)

We tracked 35 individuals from two colonies using high frequency GPS-dataloggers over four consecutive breeding seasons. Contrary to expectations, kestrels relied heavily on thermal soaring when foraging, especially during periods of high solar radiation. This produced a circadian pattern in the kestrel flight strategy that led to a spatial segregation of foraging areas. Kestrels flapped towards foraging areas close to the colony when thermals were not available. However, as soon as thermals were formed, they soared on them towards foraging areas far from the colony, especially when they were surrounded by poor foraging habitats. This reduced the chick provisioning rate at the colony. Given that lesser kestrels have a preference for feeding on large insects, and considering the average distance they cover to capture them during foraging trips, to commute using flapping flight would result in a negative energy balance for the family group. Our results show that lesser kestrels prioritize saving energy when foraging, suggesting that kestrels are more energy than time-constrained during the breeding season.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2011-06-15 00:48:34.000,2016-06-20 09:30:34.000,876767,Falco naumanni,GPS,jhpliego (Jesús Hernández-Pliego)

Migratory divides exist for many birds, however for many taxa it is unclear where such boundaries lie, and to what extent these affect the connectivity of species breeding across their ranges. Sabine’s gulls (Xema sabini) have a patchy, circumpolar breeding distribution and overwinter in two ecologically similar areas in different ocean basins: the Humboldt Current off the coast of Peru in the Pacific, and the Benguela Current off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia in the Atlantic. We used geolocators to track Sabine’s gulls breeding at a colony in the Canadian High Arctic to determine their migratory pathways and wintering sites. Our study provides evidence that birds from this breeding site disperse to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans during the non-breeding season, which suggests that a migratory divide for this species exists in the Nearctic. Remarkably, members of one mated pair wintered in opposite oceans. Our results ultimately suggest that colonization of favorable breeding habitat may be one of the strongest drivers of range expansion in the High Arctic.

In homing pigeons, HF supports navigation by familiar landmarks and landscape features. However, what has remained relatively unexplored is the importance of HF for the retention of previously acquired spatial information. For example, to date, no systematic GPS-tracking studies on the retention of HF-dependent navigational memory in homing pigeons have been performed. Therefore, the current study was designed to compare the pre- and post-surgical navigational performance of sham-lesioned control and HF-lesioned pigeons tracked from three different sites located in different directions with respect to home. The pre- and post-surgical comparison of the pigeons’ flight paths near the release sites and before reaching the area surrounding the home loft (4 km radius from the loft) revealed that the control and HF-lesioned pigeons displayed similarly successful retention. By contrast, the HF-lesioned pigeons displayed dramatically and consistently impaired retention in navigating to their home loft during the terminal phase of the homing flight near home, i.e., where navigation is supported by memory for landmark and landscape features. The data demonstrate that HF lesions lead to a dramatic loss of pre-surgically acquired landmark and landscape navigational information while sparing those mechanisms associated with navigation from locations distant from home.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2019-06-11 07:51:31.000,2019-07-30 12:24:48.000,1269952,Columba livia,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

Over 20 years, there have been 55 transatlantic recoveries of Common Terns from the Azores population: six from Argentina and 49 from Brazil.The three tracked birds migrated south in different months (August, September, November), but the northern migration was more synchronous, with all leaving in April. The birds were tracked to three areas of the South American coast: the male spent November–April on the northern Brazilian coast (13N–2S), whereas the two females first spent some time off central-eastern Brazil (4–16S; one for 1 week, the other for 3 months) and then moved south to the coast of south-easternBrazil, Uruguay and northern Argentina (24–39S). Although caution is needed given the small sample size and errors associated with geolocation, the three tracked terns potentially travelled a total of ~23 200 km to and returning from their non-breeding areas, representing an average movement of ~500 km day–1. With the exception of Belém, in northern Brazil, and Lagoa do Peixe, in southern Brazil, the coastal areas used by the tracked birds were also those with concentrations of ringing recoveries, confirming their importance as non-breeding areas for birds from the Azores.

We attached satellite-monitored tags to seven WGWs on their primary feeding ground off Sakhalin Island, Russia, three of which subsequently migrated to regions occupied by non-endangered eastern gray whales (EGWs). A female with the longest-lasting tag visited all three major EGW reproductive areas off Baja California, Mexico, before returning to Sakhalin Island the following spring. Her 22 511 km round-trip is the longest documented mammal migration and strongly suggests that some presumed WGWs are actually EGWs foraging in areas historically attributed to WGWs. The observed migration routes provide evidence of navigational skills across open water that break the near-shore north–south migratory paradigm of EGWs. Despite evidence of genetic differentiation, these tagging data indicate that the population identity of whales off Sakhalin Island needs further evaluation.

Until recently, few data existed to document this migration, and none existed for North Pacific breeders. In this study, we tracked 6 Alaskan Arctic terns tagged with combined light geolocation and saltwater immersion tags  through  their  fall  migration.  During  fall  2007,  these  birds  used  several  highly  productive stopover locations to refuel during their southward migration: the California Current, the northern and southern Humboldt Current, and the Patagonian Shelf. At least 3 of the birds went on to winter in the Weddell Sea region of Antarctica, where Arctic terns from several Atlantic populations are also known to winter. Analysis of the first ever post-breeding behavioral data collected on this species showed that the birds foraged extensively in these staging areas, spending more time for-aging  on  days  when  they  were  located  within  staging  areas  during  the  fall  migration.  We  also found that the birds were exclusively diurnal foragers, spending their nights standing out of the water and/or flying. Arctic terns likely face strict time constraints throughout the migration, timing stopovers  to  match  production  while  simultaneously  aiming  to  arrive  at  the  wintering  grounds with sufficient time remaining to complete the winter molt before returning north. Ecological disturbance at any of these locations could have serious consequences for many birds. Further, predicted effects of climate change in the Weddell Sea region could have repercussions throughout the global Arctic tern population.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,Solar Geolocator,aly.mcknight (Aly McKnight)

However, advances in global positioning technology now allow researchers to investigate movements of smaller seabirds. We tracked black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla using geolocator tags during the non-breeding season. Although kittiwakes as a group appear to be generalists with respect to overwintering strategy, our data indicate that individual birds are more specialized in their use of wintering habitat. Among birds tagged in the Gulf of Alaska, we identified 3 groups employing different wintering strategies: (1) resident birds that remain in the northern Gulf of Alaska; (2) coastal birds that remain within coastal and shelf waters but move as far south as California; and (3) pelagic birds that travel up to 1700 km offshore. Given that wintering conditions differ in widely spaced areas, the effects of winter on bird survival and body condition are likely not the same on all birds in a colony, as is often assumed. Activity data revealed that kittiwakes are almost entirely diurnal during the non-breeding season. We found significant differences in time allocation among wintering groups: birds that remained in the colony region spent less time loafing during the day and engaged in longer daytime flying and foraging bouts than birds that wintered farther from the colony. These differences suggest that wintering birds make trade-offs among travel distance, metabolic demands, and foraging quality.

The objectives of this research are to identify distinctive grazing personalities in Hereford beef cattle and to test for genotype-to-phenotype associations of grazing behaviors. The approach proposes to take advantage of the natural and distinctive grazing personalities displayed by domesticated livestock; thus, rangelands’ health can be enhanced and the negative environmental impact of free-range livestock systems is reduced.
I am searching for cattle herds that explore and use the whole landscape using the individual differences on grazing behaviors of domesticated herbivores. By spreading livestock grazing pressure across grazing lands and minimizing the use of naturally rare and fragile areas such low herbaceous plant communities, free-range livestock systems enhance grassland functions and services and reduce negative impact of the environment. Using GPS-tracking collars and satellite image data, I observed the grazing behavior of Hereford beef cattle in a few farms in Canterbury, New Zealand.
For this project, I built 120 GPS-tracking collars outfitted with long-lasting batteries and large data storage capacity. During the first year, I conducted a longitudinal behavioral sampling by collaring fewer cows (ca. 80) and by recording grazing behavior for relatively long periods (30 to 90 days). In the second year, I collared a much larger number of cows for shorter periods in a cross-sectional behavioral sampling.
I collected blood samples from all animals with behavioral data to investigate the genetic variation of ‘grazing-related genes’. They aim is to combine the grazing behavioral data with their corresponding genetic profile to seek for genotype-to-phenotype associations within the Hereford breed.

This dataset corresponds to my second year of grazing behavior sampling (cross-sectional data set) on mostly Hereford cows and some Hereford cross animals. For more details, updates and related publications, please visit:

Bird migration is usually considered to be movements between breeding and wintering areas, while less attention has been paid to other long-distance movements such as moult migration.<br>
Methods: We use high-resolution satellite-tracking data from 58 taiga bean geese Anser fabalis fabalis from the years 2019–2020, to study their moult migration during breeding season. We show the moulting sites, estimate the migratory connectivity between the breeding and the moulting sites, and estimate the utilization distributions during moult. We reveal migration routes and compare the length and timing of migration between moult migrants and successful breeders.<br>
Results: All satellite-tracked non-breeding and unsuccessfully breeding taiga bean geese migrated annually to the island of Novaya Zemlya in the high Arctic for wing moult, meaning that a large part of the population gathers at the moulting sites outside the breeding range annually for approximately three months. Migratory connectivity between breeding and moulting sites was very low (rm =  − 0.001, 95% CI − 0.1562–0.2897), indicating that individuals from different breeding grounds mix with each other on the moulting sites. Moult migrants began fall migration later in autumn than successful breeders, and their overall annual migration distance was over twofold compared to the successful breeders.<br>
Conclusions: Regular moult migration makes the Arctic an equally relevant habitat for the taiga bean goose population as their boreal breeding and temperate wintering grounds, and links ecological communities in these biomes. Moult migration plays an important role in the movement patterns and spatio-temporal distribution of the population. Low migratory connectivity between breeding and moulting sites can potentially contribute to the gene flow within the population. Moult migration to the high Arctic exposes the population to the rapid impacts of global warming to Arctic ecosystems. Additionally, Novaya Zemlya holds radioactive contaminants from various sources, which might still pose a threat to moult migrants. Generally, these results show that moult migration may essentially contribute to the way we should consider bird migration and migratory flyways.<br><b>Note:</b> Nesting locations are not included in this dataset.",research,true,true,false,true,False,na,2019-06-01 00:01:00.000,2020-11-20 17:55:00.000,840212,Anser fabalis,GPS,antti (Antti Piironen)

but no studies have assessed nocturnal habitat use by wintering shorebirds at this inland site. From February to
May 2013, the day and night habitat associations of radio-tagged Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were compared between
post-harvest flooded rice fields and managed freshwater wetlands in the Sacramento Valley. Dunlin had decreasing
associations with rice during both day and night from February to April. Dunlin exclusively used rice at night until
25 March, when they shifted to wetlands. During the day, Dunlin were regularly associated with both rice and wetlands
until 4 March, and they exclusively used wetlands beginning 25 March. Diel movements by individual Dunlin
revealed that birds using rice during the day also used rice during the subsequent night. Our findings suggest that
flooded rice, when available, may be more suitable as nocturnal habitat than managed wetlands, and the removal
of water from rice fields in February and March causes Dunlin to either use wetlands exclusively or leave the area.
Conservation of Dunlin, and likely other migratory shorebirds, may be enhanced by managing the agriculture-wetland
mosaic in the Sacramento Valley to ensure that an adequate amount of shallow-water habitats remain during
March and April, prior to spring migration.",research,true,true,false,true,False,na,2013-02-08 00:00:00.000,2013-04-23 00:00:00.000,212,"Calidris alpina,Limnodromus scolopaceus",Radio Transmitter,auoptimo (Blake Barbaree)

A predator’s habitat use is defined by its home range, which is influenced by its selection or avoidance of habitat features and intra- and inter-specific interactions within the landscape. These are driven by both innate and learned behaviour, operating at different spatial scales. We examined the seasonal home ranges and habitat selection of actively-managed populations of a native apex predator (dingo Canis dingo) and invasive mesopredator (feral cat Felis catus) in semi-arid Western Australia to better understanding their sympatric landscape use, potential interactions, and to help guide their management.   
Methods: We used kernel density estimates to characterise the seasonal space use of dingoes and feral cats, investigate inter- and intra-species variation in their home range extent and composition, and examine second-order habitat selection for each predator. Further, we used discrete choice modelling and step selection functions to examine the difference in third-order habitat selection across several habitat features.  
Results: The seasonal home ranges of dingoes were on average 19.5 times larger than feral cats. Feral cat seasonal home ranges typically included a larger proportion of grasslands than expected relative to availability in the study site, indicating second-order habitat selection for grasslands.  In their fine-scale movements (third-order habitat selection), both predators selected for roads, hydrological features (seasonal intermittent streams, seasonal lakes and wetlands), and high vegetation cover. Dingoes also selected strongly for open woodlands, whereas feral cats used open woodlands and grasslands in proportion to availability.  
Management Recommendations: Based on these results, and in order to avoid unintended negative ecological consequences (e.g. mesopredator release) that may stem from non-selective predator management, we recommend that feral cat control focuses on techniques such as trapping and shooting that are specific to feral cats in areas where they overlap with apex predators (dingoes), and more general techniques such as poison baiting where they are segregated.

The DoD Legacy Program funded our work focusing on the value of military installations in Alaska to breeding Rusty Blackbirds from 2007–2010. We found that the birds nested in abundance in these unfragmented habitats and exhibited high reproductive success. Survival rates are similar to stable populations of Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) and declining populations Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) breeding in the contiguous U.S. This work has also contributed to the range-wide investigations by the International Rusty Blackbird Technical Group. This collaborative effort has identified general linkages between breeding and wintering sites, elevated mercury exposure in the eastern breeding range as well as in some birds in Alaska, and an unexpected prevalence of blood parasites in wintering populations. The species continues to decline 5–12% annually range-wide (including a 5% decline per year in Alaska). The projected involved close collaboration with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to address three high-priority objectives: (1) Determine whether annual survival or recruitment rates are causing the species’ long-term decline.

Results from all three methods, consisting of 79 ring recoveries, four light level geolocator tracks and 388 feather δ2H values, indicate low degrees of migratory connectivity. The isotope data provide evidence for leapfrog migration with the more southerly populations traveling greater distances to the breeding grounds than more centrally wintering individuals. Location estimates of four annual journeys revealed individually consistent migration strategies with relatively short flight bouts separated by two to three and two to six stopover sites during spring and autumn migration, respectively.

In 2011, grey-headed flying foxes formed a camp in Adelaide, South Australia, outside their previously recorded range. We used global positioning system telemetry to study the movements and foraging behaviour of this species in Adelaide in spring (September to November) 2015. High-frequency location data were used to determine the foraging range and the most frequently visited foraging sites used by each bat which were ground-truthed to identify forage plants. A total of 7239 valid locations were collected over 170 nights from four collars. Despite being a highly mobile species, the mean core foraging range estimate was only 7.30 km2 (range 3.3–11.2 km2). Maximum foraging distance from the camp in the Botanic Park was 9.5 km but most foraging occurred within a 4-km radius. The most common foraging sites occurred within the residential area of Adelaide and included introduced forage plant species, Lemon-scented gum (Corymbia citriodora) and Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa). Other observed movement activities included dipping behaviour on inland and marine waters and travel across flight paths around Adelaide airport. Our findings suggest that urban habitats in Adelaide provide sufficient foraging resources for grey-headed flying foxes to use these areas exclusively, at least in spring. This creates substantial opportunities for bats to interact with humans and their infrastructure.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2015-08-31 14:42:38.000,2015-11-02 02:00:33.000,145262,Pteropus poliocephalus,GPS,droshier (David Roshier)

breeding range. Two complete migrations for two individuals were documented, and they demonstrated fidelity to winter range. The longest, fastest movement documented was 2,300 km in less than 74 hr. Extensive, post-breeding dispersal was not observed in the adult male American Bitterns in this study. Six male American Bitterns were marked with PTTs on winter range in Florida and Texas.

Data uploaded to a colony base station using UHF radiowaves. Duty cycles were programmed to record at 15 min sampling intervals for periods coincident with the breeding season (late Apr to early Oct, see section 2.2). Data for this study archived in this repository are limited to positions within 150km of Nova Scotia and to positions within a time window overlapping the breeding period, from Apr-30 through Oct-06. Some devices ceased transmission within one month of deployment while others continued to function through three breeding seasons. 

Raw data processing was conducted using R 4.0.2 (R Core Team 2020). Raw positional datasets for each bird were quality-controlled  using the SDLfilter package. We removed temporal duplicates and positions associated with unrealistic movement rates using a maximum of 100 km/h for herring gulls. Quality-controlled datasets for each bird were interpolated to 15-min intervals using the interpolateTime function in the move package, without interpolating over data gaps in the time series > 1 h.

However, we still have little understanding how everyday herding affects ecosystems at the landscape level. We conducted a study of daily herd movements and grazing strategies in a mobile pastoral system in the Logone floodplain, Cameroon. We integrated GPS/GIS technology, video recordings of animal behavior, and ethnographic methods to develop a more accurate measurement of grazing pressure that takes into account both livestock densities and grazing behavior. We used the resulting grazing pressure data to evaluate existing conceptual models of grazing pressure at a landscape level. We found that models that predict that grazing pressure is skewed towards the direction of water most accurately reflect the situation in the Logone floodplain in the dry season. However, we found that the higher grazing pressure is not only the result of a higher density of cattle but also a change in the grazing behavior of animals after watering. Finally, we caution that the models of grazing pressure in the dry season cannot simply be extrapolated to the landscape level because mobile pastoralists do not remain in one central place.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-03-11 05:13:00.000,2009-03-26 05:04:00.000,166921,Bos taurus,GPS,Mark Moritz (Mark Moritz)

One tag provided locations until April 21 and that thrush was consistently detected within a ~1 ha area through the winter.

Passive soaring birds utilise warm rising‐air columns (thermals) to climb up and obtain potential energy for flying across large areas. However, the utilisation of such inconsistent natural resources may be challenging for soaring‐gliding birds and involve a set of decisions to maintain efficient flight. (2) To assess which temporal scales of previous experience with environmental inputs best predicted thermal‐climbing departure decisions of soaring birds, we used movement data from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) tracked by GPS transmitters. We applied Cox proportional hazard regression and a model selection approach to identify thermal‐climbing departure decisions and to compare a range of temporal scales. (3) Our findings support the use of current and recent (short‐term; last 20 minutes) experiences, compared to longer term, past experiences, in predicting the time until departure from thermals. The models supported decision rules that integrated information originating from different temporal scales, implying a tendency to depart from a thermal later when the current climb rate was stronger than experienced recently and vice‐versa. Additionally, climb rates in thermals revealed significant autocorrelation over short time scales (shorter than 30 minutes).

Interspecific differences in morphology (through the effect on perceptual range and motion ability) and searchers’ spatial dispersion (due to different roost arrangements) are in correspondence with the empirically observed advantage of LFV over WBV searchers, whereas differences in other aspects of the movement patterns appear to play a minor role.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2008-03-28 13:50:00.000,2010-07-21 15:09:59.000,346650,"Gyps africanus,Torgos tracheliotus",GPS,ors (Orr Spiegel)

Flying organisms, such as bats, may thus benefit from modifying their flight in response to the wind vector. Yet, practical difficulties have so far limited the understanding of this response for free-ranging bats. We tracked nine straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) that flew 42.5+17.5km (mean + s.d.) to and from their roost near Accra, Ghana. Following detailed atmospheric simulations, we found that bats compensated for wind drift, as predicted under constant winds, and decreased their airspeed in response to tailwind assistance such that their groundspeed remained nearly constant. In addition, bats increased their airspeed with increasing crosswind speed. Overall, bats modulated their airspeed in relation to wind speed at different wind directions in a manner predicted by a two-dimensional optimal move- ment model. We conclude that sophisticated behavioural mechanisms to minimize the cost of transport under various wind conditions have evolved in bats. The bats’ response to the wind is similar to that reported for migratory birds and insects, suggesting convergent evolution of flight behaviours in volant organisms.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2011-02-02 18:22:30.000,2011-02-09 04:05:01.000,614,Eidolon helvum,GPS,nir_sapir (Nir Sapir)

The Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis (LFFH) suggests a single optimal food search strategy to explain this pattern, yet mixed movement distributions are biologically more plausible and often convincingly fit movement data. To confront alternative explanations for these patterns, we tracked vultures of three species in two very different ecosystems using high-resolution GPS/accelerometer tags accompanied by behavioral, genetic and morphological data. The Lévy distribution fitted the datasets reasonably well, matching expectations based on their sparsely distributed food resources; yet, the fit of mixed models was considerably better, suggesting distinct movement modes operating at three different scales. Specifically, long-range forays (LRFs)—rare, short-term, large-scale circular journeys that greatly exceed the typical foraging range and contribute to the tail-fatness of the movement distribution in all three species—do not match an optimal foraging strategy suggested by the LFFH. We also found no support for preferred weather conditions or population genetic structure as alternative explanations, so the hypothesis that LRFs represent failed breeding dispersal attempts to find mates remains our most plausible explanation at this time.

We translocated birds westward (1080 km) or eastward (885 km) to simulate natural navigational challenges. When translocated westwards and outside their migratory corridor birds with olfactory nerve section kept a clear directional preference (southerly) but were unable to compensate for the displacement, while intact birds and gulls with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve sectioned oriented towards their population-specific migratory corridor.

Space use estimates can inform conservation management but relaying high-accuracy locations is often not straightforward. We used Fastloc-GPS Argos satellite tags with the innovation of additional data relay via a ground station (termed a “Mote”) to record high volumes (typically > 20 locations per individual per day) of high accuracy tracking data. Tags were attached in the Chagos Archipelago in 2018-2019 to 23 immature turtles of two species for which there have been long-standing conservation concerns: 21 hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) and two green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Over long tracking durations (mean 227.6 days per individual), most turtles moved very little. For example, 17 of 21 hawksbill turtles remained continuously in the lagoon where they were equipped, with 95% and 50% Utilisation Distributions (UDs) averaging only 1.03 and 0.18 km2 respectively. Many individuals, and both species, could use the same small spaces, i.e., individuals did not maintain unique home ranges. However, three hawksbill turtles travelled 100s of km from the tagging site. Our results show that for some large marine vertebrates, even small protected areas of only a few km2 can encompass the movements of a large proportion of individuals over long periods. High accuracy tracking may likewise reveal the details of space use for many other animals that move little and/or use important focal areas and where previous low-accuracy tracking techniques have tended to overestimate space use.",research,true,true,false,true,False,na,2018-06-27 12:24:00.000,2019-12-08 17:08:16.000,88727,"Chelonia mydas,Eretmochelys imbricata",GPS,HaysLab (Alex Rattray)

Here, we investigate flight behaviour in seven free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) and report that the maximum ground speeds achieved exceed speeds previously documented for any bat. Regional wind modelling indicates that bats adjusted flight speeds in response to winds by flying more slowly as wind support increased and flying faster when confronted with crosswinds, as demonstrated for insects, birds and other bats. Increased frequency of pauses in wing beats at faster speeds suggests that flap-gliding assists the bats’ rapid flight.

What information individuals use for movement coordination is, however, very difficult to know, except for echolocating bats. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, we can accurately measure the biosonar calls of interacting bats with a group of microphones and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. When observing pairs of Daubenton's bats foraging low over water for stranded insects, we found they have intriguing `traffic rules' - they chase each other, perform tandem turns and even slow down to avoid collision. When we then modelled their biosonar view of the surroundings during these interactions we discovered that one simple trick suffices to create all their interactive behaviours: once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual's flight direction within 4-5 of your own wingbeats.<br>NOTE: Sensor type is 2D videogrammetry, not GPS.

Twenty-seven PTTs provided tracking data after birds departed their capture areas. After the breeding season murrelets migrated toward the Bering Sea, with short periods of movement (median 2 d) separated by short stopovers (median 1 d). During movements, travel averaged 79.4 km d-1 (83.5 SD, 449.1 maximum). All five Kittlitz’s Murrelets tagged in Prince William Sound in May 2011 were tracked to the Bering Sea by August and four subsequently continued north to the Chukchi and Beaufort seas (Arctic Ocean), accumulating total movement distances of 2500–4000 km. Many birds spent 2-3 weeks with little movement along coasts of the Alaska Peninsula or eastern Bering Sea during late August through September, which corresponds to the pre-basic molt period.

Although there has been an increasing emphasis on making animal movement data publicly available, there has also been a conspicuous dearth in the availability of such data on large carnivores. Globally, large predators are of conservation concern. However, due to their secretive behavior and low densities, obtaining movement data on apex predators is expensive and logistically challenging. Consequently, the relatively small sample sizes typical of large carnivore movement studies may limit insights into the ecology and behavior of these elusive predators. The aim of this initiative is to make available to the conservation-scientific community a dataset of 134,690 locations of jaguars (Panthera onca) collected from 117 individuals (54 males and 63 females) tracked by GPS technology. [The published dataset here represents a portion of this dataset.] Individual jaguars were monitored in five different range countries representing a large portion of the species’ distribution. This dataset may be used to answer a variety of ecological questions including but not limited to: improved models of connectivity from local to continental scales; the use of natural or human-modified landscapes by jaguars; movement behavior of jaguars in regions not represented in this dataset; intraspecific interactions; and predator-prey interactions. In making our dataset publicly available, we hope to motivate other research groups to do the same in the near future. Specifically, we aim to help inform a better understanding of jaguar movement ecology with applications towards effective decision making and maximizing long-term conservation efforts for this ecologically important species.

We compared two contexts of flock composition: flocks of birds of the same age and flight experience; and, flocks of birds of different ages and flight experience. All flocks displayed consistent leadership-based structures over time, showing that individuals have stable roles in the navigational decisions of the flock. However, flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability, indicating that these factors promote flock structuring.

We radio tracked water opossums and collected information about their habitats and behaviour from October 2004 to April 2010. We combined common home range estimators for animals living in linear habitats with the synoptic model of home range and habitat selection. For the 10 individuals monitored, the home ranges varied between 0.80 and 9.66 km of watercourses; none of them had exclusive home ranges. The home range size for males was, on average, three times larger than for females. The overlap data showed that, on average, one male could encompass the home ranges of up to five females simultaneously, but more than one male could have access to the same female. For habitat selection at the individual level, we could not find any strong influence of habitat features on water opossum preferences because individuals selected different sets of habitat variables. However, at the population level, we found a negative relationship between home range size and river size. The water opossum seems to prefer shallow and narrow watercourses to establish its home ranges. Here, we present valuable information to advance our knowledge of the water opossum and its ecology, which is urgent for conservation purposes.",research,true,true,false,true,False,na,2005-07-02 15:00:00.000,2010-05-03 04:47:00.000,357,Chironectes minimus,Radio Transmitter,melinatarituba (Melina Leite)

Extreme weather events have the potential to alter both short- and long-term population dynamics as well as community- and ecosystem-level function. Such events are rare and stochastic, making it difficult to fully document how organisms respond to them and predict the repercussions of similar events in the future.<br>
2. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which short-term events can incur long-term consequences, we documented the behavioural responses and fitness consequences for a long-distance migratory bird, the continental black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa limosa, resulting from a spring snowstorm and three-week period of record low temperatures.<br>
3. The event caused measurable responses at three spatial scales—continental, regional, and local—including migratory delays (+19 d), reverse migrations (>90 km), elevated metabolic costs (+8.8% maintenance metabolic rate), and increased foraging rates (+37%).<br>
4. There were few long-term fitness consequences, however, and subsequent breeding seasons instead witnessed high levels of reproductive success and little evidence of carry-over effects.<br>
5. This suggests that populations with continued access to food, behavioural flexibility, and time to dissipate the costs of the event can likely withstand the consequences of an extreme weather event. For populations constrained in one of these respects, though, extreme events may entail extreme ecological consequences.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2013-02-02 08:49:30.000,2014-05-30 21:15:34.000,17403,Limosa limosa,Argos Doppler Shift,Blackwits (Team Piersma)

However, a long history of overexploitation has severely reduced populations for many of these species. This project will investigate how these megafauna species can coexist with people along exploitation gradients in aquatic habitats of Brazilian Amazonia. Using an innovative landscape ecology approach, a highly experienced team will target key knowledge gaps on the threats and ecology of Amazonian aquatic megafauna, including historical overexploitation trends, current threats, spatial ecology, habitat requirements and conservation solutions for each species. Beyond this research program, we will expand an existing conservation model targeting Arapaima and the Giant South American Turtle, to consolidate a basin-wide network of community-managed environments that will ensure umbrella protection for the entire aquatic ecosystem. In this model, community-based conservation provides a promising solution to recover wild populations of aquatic megafauna, providing an impressive ‘win-win’ sustainable development option to ensure both biodiversity conservation and local welfare.

Birds were monitored for up to 3 years, 2011‒2014. Monitoring signals indicated breeding grounds in the Taimyr and Yamal regions; important staging sites on the coasts of the southern Pechora Sea and the Kara Sea; and wintering areas that ranged from NW- Ireland to Guinea Bissau. The average distance traveled from wintering grounds to breeding grounds was 5534 km. Migration duration varied between 42 and 152 days; during this period birds spent about 95% of the time at staging sites. In spring most plovers crossed inland Eastern Europe, whereas in autumn most followed the coastline. Almost all of the birds departed during favorable wind conditions within just 4 days (27‒30 May) on northward migration from the Wadden Sea. In spring birds migrated significantly faster between the Wadden Sea and the Arctic than on return migration in autumn (12 vs. 37 days), with shorter stopovers during the northward passage.

However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland’s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across the breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, though in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland’s Warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle.

Here we study the ecology of the little-known Yellow-throated Bunting Emberiza elegans based on a multi-year study on its breeding grounds in the Russian Far East. For the first time in this species, we quantified breeding habitat parameters, calculated sex-specific apparent survival, and determined individual non-breeding locations using light-level geolocation.
We found that the habitat around song posts of male Yellow-throated Buntings is characterized by tree and shrub layers on richly littered moist ground. Habitat use overlaps with co-occurring Tristram´s Buntings Emberiza tristrami and Black-faced Buntings E. spodocephala, but territories differ especially in tree cover and litter cover. 
Based on four years of colour-ringing data of 72 individuals, we calculated an apparent survival rate of 36 %, with higher survival estimates for male than for female Yellow-throated Buntings. We found no effect of carrying a geolocator on survival. 
We retrieved six geolocators from males. All birds migrated south-westward during autumn and spent the non-breeding season at locations in China 700-1700 km away from their breeding sites. At least two individuals spent the boreal winter outside of the known range in northern or central China. Birds left the breeding area between early October and early November and returned between mid-March and mid-April.
Our data on habitat use, survival rate and migratory connectivity will help to assess threats to the populations of this enigmatic species, which might include habitat loss due to forest fires on the breeding grounds, and unsustainable harvest for consumption during the non-breeding season.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2018-07-16 10:58:38.000,2020-05-28 18:46:57.000,2097,Emberiza elegans,Solar Geolocator,wielandheim (Wieland Heim)

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-08-04 18:55:26.000,2015-08-06 19:04:26.000,4263,"Balaenoptera physalus,Balaenoptera musculus",Argos Doppler Shift,tomasf (Tomas)

Fenced reserves from which invasive predators are removed are increasingly used as a conservation management tool, because they provide safe havens for susceptible threatened species, and create dense populations of native wildlife that could act as a source population for recolonising the surrounding landscape. However, the latter effect might also act as a food source, and promote high densities of invasive predators on the edges of such reserves. Aims. Our study aimed to determine whether activity ofthe feral cat is greater around the edges ofa fenced conservation
reserve, Arid Recovery, in northern South Australia. This reserve has abundant native rodents that move through the fence into the surrounding landscape. Methods. We investigated (1) whether feral cats were increasingly likely to be detected on track transects closer to the
fence over time as populations ofnative rodents increased inside the reserve, (2) whether native rodents were more likely to be found in the stomachs ofcats caught close to the reserve edge, and (3) whether individual cats selectively hunted on the reserve fence compared with two other similar fences, on the basis ofGPS movement data. Key results. We found that (1) detection rates of feral cats on the edges of a fenced reserve increased through time as populations of native rodents increased inside the reserve, (2) native rodents were far more likely to be found in the stomach ofcats collected at the reserve edge than in the stomachs ofcats far from the reserve edge, and (3) GPS tracking of cat movements showed a selection for the reserve fence edge, but not for similar fences away from the reserve. Conclusions. Invasive predators such as feral cats are able to focus their movements and activity to where prey availability is greatest, including the edges offenced conservation reserves. This limits the capacity ofreserves to function as source areas from which animals can recolonise the surrounding landscape, and increases predation pressure on populations of other species living on the reserve edge. Implications. Managers offenced conservation reserves should be aware that increased predator control may be critical
for offsetting the elevated impacts of feral cats attracted to the reserve fence.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,,,,,GPS,hmcgregor104 (Hugh McGregor)

Despite numerous observations of songbirds migrating over remote islands, virtually nothing is known about the proportion of songbirds risking to fly offshore rather than to follow the coastline. By means of large-scale automated radio-telemetry, we individually tracked songbirds during their autumn migration through the German Bight area in the south-eastern North Sea. Our tracking network facilitated the recording of movement patterns over the bay and, for the first time, the estimation of the proportions of individuals embarking on offshore flights from their coastal stopover sites. Our data are consistent with previous observations of decreasing migration densities from nearshore to offshore, i.e. from east to west in autumn. Still, we revealed a considerable proportion of 25% of birds flying offshore. The tendency to fly offshore decreased from west to south migrants, which is in line with optimal bird migration theory. Among south-west migrating species, which also comprise the vast majority of songbird species migrating through the German Bight area, thrushes showed the highest proportions of offshore flights. Considering the recent and ongoing increase of artificial offshore structures, our results suggest that some species or species groups might especially face an increased risk of being negatively affected.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2017-09-27 17:15:00.000,2019-09-15 21:01:13.000,430,"Sturnus vulgaris,Turdus merula,Turdus iliacus,Acrocephalus schoenobaenus,Erithacus rubecula,Prunella modularis,Sylvia atricapilla,Sylvia borin,Sylvia communis,Turdus philomelos",Radio Transmitter,VeraBrust (Vera Brust)

compared with those obtained using similar methods at
the same site during 1983-84 by Tom Butynski. During
the present study, group size ranged from 16 to 28 monkeys.
The results show that the group size of blue monkeys
(Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni) has increased significantly
between 1984 and 2009. Mean group size has increased
over two-fold from 9 after the fission of group 33 during
Butynski s study to 21.6 animals per group in 2009. These

We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic-breeding geese on different flyways (Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12)) to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers, and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition; and at the breeding grounds early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. However, the birds’ precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules.

Broad-scale habitat fragmentation is a visible result of human land-use throughout the world, often resulting in deleterious ecological outcomes. The ability of fauna to persist in fragmented landscapes is influenced by their capacity to move and access important resources such as food, water and shelter. When resources are depleted and spatially heterogeneous, identifying high quality habitat patches and understanding how individuals move through the landscape is critical for effective faunal conservation and management.

Phillip Island, located south of Australia, is a highly modified and fragmented landscape that contains patches of native vegetation amongst a matrix of agricultural farmland and urban developments. The island supports an abundant population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), but little is known about how individuals move through this landscape. 
We developed and tested an inexpensive custom-made GPS wildlife tracker that sends data via the mobile phone network. High-resolution movement data gained from the trackers enabled us to highlights features that facilitate movement and others that represent barriers. Further we modelled how wallabies select resources within the landscape and move both within and between patches. Information about movement patterns and resource selection generated by the analysis will inform and improve the management of swamp wallabies in human-modified and fragmented landscapes and more generally enhance our understanding of the challenges faced by fauna in changing environments worldwide.

This information is needed to model the potential effects of off-shore oil and gas development, economic development of coastal areas, and the potential effects of a warming arctic. We used satellite telemetry (PTTs) to characterize migration and to identify wintering and staging areas of eiders that nested in: (1) northern Alaska (coastal barrier islands in the western Beaufort Sea between -149.940° and -145.941°; (2) western Alaska at Cape Espenberg (66.50°, -163.50°); (3) western Alaska on the YKD (61.173°, -165.597°); and (4) the Aleutian Archipelago. Wintering and stop-over locations of the most northern nesting population were in the most northern polynya (1300-1600 km from the nesting area) that predictably remained open throughout the winter. Birds from Cape Espenberg wintered to the south in open waters (400-700 km from the nesting area) and used the same general areas as the birds from the western Beaufort Sea and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Birds from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta winter in waters offshore from the marking location to open waters on the Alaska Peninsula. Eiders marked in the Aleutian Archipelago did not leave the Archipelago.

We measured multiple aspects of parent behavior at and away from the nest while controlling for measures of weather conditions. We found no significant interactive effects of manipulated brood size and parental costs. Both sexes increased their visitation rate with brood size, but nestlings in enlarged broods grew significantly less post-brood size manipulation than those in reduced broods. Foraging range area was highly variable among GPS-tagged females but was unaffected by brood size. As such, increased visitation rate in response to brood size may be more energetically costly for far-ranging females. GPS-tagged females did not alter their visitation rate relative to un-tagged birds, but their mates had higher visitation rates.

Animals frequently forage in groups on ephemeral resources to profit from social information and increased efficiency. Greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, develop group-specific social calls, which are hypothesized to coordinate social foraging to feed on patchily distributed balsa flowers. To test this, we tagged all members of three social groups of P. hastatus on Isla Colon, Panama, using high-frequency GPS during a season when balsa had begun to flower. We found that bats commuted 20-30 km to foraging sites, more than double the distance reported previously. In contrast to our expectations, we found that tagged individuals did not commute together, but did join group members in small foraging patches with high densities of flowering balsas on the mainland. We hypothesized that close proximity to group members would increase foraging efficiency if social foraging were used to find flower clusters, but distance between tagged individuals did not predict foraging efficiency or energy expenditure. However, decreased distance among tagged bats positively influenced the time spent outside roosting caves and increased the duration and synchrony of resting. These results suggest that social proximity appears to be more important during resting and that factors other than increased feeding efficiency may structure social relationships of group members while foraging. It appears that, depending on the local resource landscape, these bats have an excellent map even of distant resources and may use social information only for current patch discovery. They then may no longer rely on social information during daily foraging.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2016-02-29 01:35:00.000,2016-03-10 05:57:13.000,253968,Phyllostomus hastatus,GPS,teague_o (Teague O'Mara)

Considering the importance to document home range features of the this species for its conservation and the interest in documenting potential effects of radio or GPS tracking techniques in the framework of research conservation schemes dedicated to small plunge-diving birds, we implemented a pilot study aimed at providing first data allowing to: (i) assess home range features of the European Kingfisher for populations with feeding locations unevenly distributed; (ii) define conservation implications for habitats exploited by such populations; (iii) evaluate possibilities to develop GPS tracking schemes dedicated to home range studies for this species of conservation concern that may be possibly developed for other small plunge-diving birds.

Methods: In 2018 and 2019, we equipped 16 breeding European Kingfishers (Alcedo atthis) sampled within the marshes of the Gironde Estuary (France), with miniaturized and waterproof GPS archival tags deployed with leg-loop harness (total mass equipment = 1.4 g; average bird mass = 40.18 ± 1.12 g).

Results: We obtained an average record per tag retrieved (n = 13) of 35.31 ± 6.66 locations usable for analyses, without significant effects on bird body condition. For the sampled population, data analysis highlight rather small home ranges exploited by birds (average = 2.50 ± 0.55 ha) composed, on average by 2.78 ± 0.40 clusters of locations. Our results also highlight: (i) a rather important home range fragmentation index (average of the summed area pooling all clusters, divided by the area encompassing all clusters = 0.36 ± 0.08); (ii) the use by birds of different types of small wetlands (wet ditches or small ponds within alluvial forests), often exploited in addition to habitats encompassing nest locations.

Conclusion: Our study reveals interesting GPS tracking possibilities for small plunge-diving birds such as the European Kingfisher. For this species, today classified as vulnerable in Europe, our results underline the importance to develop conservation and ecological restoration policies of wetland networks, integrating small wetlands particularly sensitive to global change.",research,true,true,false,false,False,na,2018-04-07 05:32:00.000,2019-04-27 10:28:00.000,509,Alcedo atthis,GPS,Raphael Musseau (Raphael Musseau)

We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic-breeding geese on different flyways (Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12)) to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers, and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition; and at the breeding grounds early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. However, the birds’ precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules.

Other urbanized species exhibit altered annual cycles such as loss of migratory behavior and year-round breeding in response to consistent resource abundance, often related to intentional and unintentional provisioning. We used behavioral change point analysis to segment the tracks of 41 ibis equipped with GPS backpacks to identify differences in the initiation and duration of four behavioral seasons (non-breeding, pre-breeding, breeding, post-breeding) related to use of urban habitats. We found that intraspecific variation in urban habitat use had strong carryover effects on the timing and duration of behavioral seasons. In particular, ibis with higher urban habitat use in non-breeding seasons had longer non-breeding seasons and shorter breeding seasons that started earlier in the year compared to ibis that primarily use wetland habitats.

Yet, despite recent advances in tracking technology, we lack comprehensive information on the spatial structure of migratory networks across a species’ range, particularly for small-bodied, long-distance migratory animals. We constructed a migratory network for a songbird and used network-based metrics to characterize the spatial structure and prioritize regions for conservation. The network was constructed using year-round movements derived from 133 archival light-level geolocators attached to Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) originating from 12 breeding sites across their North American breeding range. From these breeding sites, we identified 10 autumn stopover nodes (regions) in North America, 13 non-breeding nodes located around the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean, and 136 unique edges (migratory routes) connecting nodes. We found strong migratory connectivity between breeding and autumn stopover sites and moderate migratory connectivity between the breeding and non-breeding sites. We identified three distinct ‘communities’ of nodes that corresponded to western, central, and eastern North American flyways. Several regions were important for maintaining network connectivity, with South Florida and Louisiana as the top ranked non-breeding nodes and the Midwest as the top ranked stopover node. We show that migratory songbird networks can have both a high degree of mixing between seasons yet still show regionally distinct migratory flyways. Such information will be crucial for accurately predicting factors that limit and regulate migratory songbirds throughout the annual cycle.

Various methods have been developed for classifying animal movement at both coarse (e.g., migratory vs. sedentary behavior) and fine (e.g., resting vs. foraging) scales. A popular approach for classifying movements at coarse resolutions involves fitting time series of net-squared displacement (NSD) to models representing different conceptualizations of coarse movement strategies (i.e., migration, nomadism, sedentarism, etc.). However, the performance of this method in classifying actual (as opposed to simulated) animal movements has been mixed. Here, we develop a more flexible method that uses the same NSD input, but relies on an underlying discrete latent state model. Using simulated data, we first assess how well patterns in the number of transitions between modes of movement and the duration of time spent in a mode classify movement strategies. We then apply our approach to elucidate variability in the movement strategies of eight giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.) using a multi-year (2009–2014) GPS dataset from three different Galapagos Islands. Results: With respect to patterns of time spent and the number of transitions between modes, our approach out- performed previous efforts to distinguish among migration, dispersal, and sedentary behavior. We documented marked inter-individual variation in giant tortoise movement strategies, with behaviors indicating migration, dispersal, nomadism and sedentarism, as well as hybrid behaviors such as “exploratory residence”. Conclusions: Distilling complex animal movement into discrete modes remains a fundamental challenge in movement ecology, a problem made more complex by the ever-longer duration, ever-finer resolution, and gap-ridden trajectories recorded by GPS devices. By clustering into modes, we derived information on the time spent within one mode and the number of transitions between modes which enabled finer differentiation of movement strategies over previous methods. Ultimately, the techniques developed here address limitations of previous approaches and provide greater insights with respect to characterization of movement strategies across scales by more fully utilizing long-term GPS telemetry datasets.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-04-29 16:00:50.000,2014-12-31 23:45:09.000,1169859,"Testudinidae ",GPS,The_giant (Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau)

Nonetheless, thorough statistical treatment of Argos datasets is often jeopardized by their coarse temporal resolution. State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets, such as the limited temporal resolution of locations and the lack of information pertaining to the behavioural state of the tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation of modelled locations on a 3-year Argos dataset of 9 breeding snowy owls to assess whether searching behaviour for breeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching and moving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked snowy owls constantly switched from moving to searching behaviour during pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow cover and depth was low. This suggests that snowy owls adapt their searching effort to environmental conditions encountered along their path.

We used noninvasive sign surveys and a multiseason occupancy modeling approach to estimate annual occupancy rates for both species and related these rates to summer precipitation. We also tracked radiomarked individuals to assess mortality risk for both species when moving in terrestrial areas. Annual model-averaged estimates of occupancy for mink and muskrat were correlated positively to summer precipitation. Mink and muskrats were widespread during a year (2008) with above-average precipitation. However, estimates of site occupancy declined substantially for mink (0.56) and especially muskrats (0.09) during the severe drought of 2012. Mink are generalist predators that probably use terrestrial habitat during droughts. However, mink had substantially greater risk of mortality away from streams. In comparison, muskrats are more restricted to aquatic habitats and likely suffered high mortality during the drought.

Overall, pigeons homing with the left eye/right hemisphere (RH) dis- played a greater fidelity to the familiar space previously experienced than pigeons homing with the right eye/left hemisphere (LH). Another difference between the two monocular groups is that LH pigeons were more likely than RH pigeons to fly with other pigeons during the group training releases.

Using geolocation devices, we identified wintering areas used by Ringed Plovers nesting in the Canadian High-Arctic and investigated migration strategies used by these Nearctic migrants along the transatlantic route. The main wintering area of the Ringed Plovers (n = 20) was located in Western Africa. We found contrasting seasonal migration patterns, with Ringed Plovers minimizing continuous flight distances over the ocean in spring by making a detour to stop in Iceland. In autumn, however, most individuals crossed the ocean in one direct flight from Southern Greenland to Western Europe, as far as Southern Spain. This likely resulted from prevailing anti-clockwise winds associated with the Icelandic low-pressure system. Moreover, the plovers we tracked largely circumvented the Greenland icecap in autumn, but in spring, some plovers apparently crossed the icecap above the 65°N. Our study highlighted the importance of Iceland as a stepping-stone during the spring migration and showed that small Nearctic migrants can perform non-stop transatlantic flights from Greenland to Southern Europe.

When predators are removed, re-colonization for some species occurs naturally, and inter-island phylogeographic relationships and current movement patterns can illuminate processes of colonization. We studied a case of re-colonization of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) following removal of introduced arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. We expected common eiders to resume nesting on islands cleared of foxes and to re-colonize from nearby islets, islands, and island groups. We thus expected common eiders to show limited genetic structure indicative of extensive mixing among island populations. Satellite telemetry was used to record current movement patterns of female common eiders from six islands across three island groups. We collected genetic data from these and other nesting common eiders at 14 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA control region to examine population genetic structure, historical fluctuations in population demography, and gene flow. Our results suggest recent interchange among islands. Analysis of microsatellite data supports satellite telemetry data of increased dispersal of common eiders to nearby areas and little between island groups. Although evidence from mtDNA is suggestive of female dispersal among island groups, gene flow is insufficient to account for recolonization and rapid population growth. Instead, near-by remnant populations of common eiders contributed substantially to population expansion, without which re-colonization would have likely occurred at a much lower rate. Genetic and morphometric data of common eiders within one island group two and three decades after re-colonization suggests reduced movement of eiders among islands and little movement between island groups after populations were re-established.

However, the role of odours in navigation is still subject to debate. While according to the olfactory navigation hypothesis homing pigeons possess a navigational map based on the distribution of environmental odours, the olfactory activation hypothesis proposes that odour perception is only needed to activate a navigational mechanism based on cues of another nature. Here we tested experimentally whether the perception of artificial odours is sufficient to allow pigeons to navigate, as expected from the olfactory activation hypothesis. We transported three groups of pigeons in air-tight containers to release sites 53 and 61 km from home in three different olfactory conditions. The Control (C) group received natural environmental air; both the Pure Air (PA) and the Artificial Odour (AO) groups received pure air filtered through an active charcoal filter. Only the Artificial Odour group received additional puffs of artificial odours until release. We then released pigeons while recording their tracks with 1Hz GPS data loggers. We also followed non-homing pigeons using an aerial data readout to a Cessna plane, allowing, for the first time, the tracking of non-homing homing pigeons. Within the first hour after release, the pigeons in both the Artificial Odour and the Pure Air group (receiving no environmental odours) showed impaired navigational performances at each release site. Our data provide evidence against an activation role of odours in navigation, and document that pigeons only navigate well when they perceive environmental odours.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2010-07-02 05:17:02.000,2010-07-21 23:26:47.000,1323779,Columba livia,GPS,martin (Martin Wikelski)

Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and, thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but, unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10–30 h, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and traveled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate. We demonstrate that ambient temperature is an important predictor of movement and water use across the landscape, with elephants responding facultatively to a “landscape of thermal stress.""",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2007-08-13 00:30:00.000,2009-08-12 21:30:00.000,283688,Loxodonta africana,GPS,abivanak (Abi Tamim Vanak)

Fruit secondary compounds can thwart beneficial dispersers in different ways, but the costs are difficult to quantify. Because seeds are difficult to follow from their parent plant to their final destination, little is known about where seeds are deposited by frugivores. Nevertheless, seeds benefit from travelling far from the parent plant as they escape from parental competition and elude specialized herbivores and pathogens that accumulate on adult plants. Thus high dispersal distance generally confers high fitness to seeds. We investigated a novel potential cost of fruit secondary compounds – reduced seed dispersal distance - by combining three datasets from previous work on a Neotropical bat-plant dispersal system (bats in the genus Carollia and plants in the genus Piper). We used data from captive behavioral experiments which show how amides in ripe fruits of Piper influence bat behavior. Previous work showed how these compounds decrease the retention time of seeds (gut retention time: GRT). With new analyses of this dataset, we further show that these defensive secondary compounds can delay the time of fruit removal. Next, with a behaviorally annotated bat telemetry dataset, we extracted post-feeding movements (i.e. seed dispersal distances). Using generalized additive mixed models we found that seed dispersal distances varied nonlinearly at short timescales (within the variation of observed GRTs) and longer timescales (over the course of the night). Last, we interrogated the models to infer that dispersal distances were reduced by: 1) previously reported amide-elicited decreases in GRT and 2) the delays in time of fruit removal by ripe fruit amides that we found in this analysis. By blending movement ecology and chemical ecology, we identified two mechanisms by which fruit secondary compounds can impose costs in terms of decreased seed dispersal distances: 1) small scale reductions in GRT and 2) causing fruits to forgo advantageous bat activity peaks that confer high seed dispersal distances.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,1994-04-14 00:10:00.000,1997-08-17 04:47:00.000,3343,"Carollia castanea,Carollia perspicillata",Radio Transmitter,JWBaldwin (Justin Baldwin)

These results are consistent with the view that local odour at the release site are critical for determining the direction of displacement (olfactory map) and suggest that pigeons consult the olfactory map also during their homing flight in order to be able to find their way home.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-07-18 09:21:00.000,2015-09-13 22:00:00.000,127076,Columba livia,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

Williamsburg, VA 23187",bdwatt@wm.edu,,"The whimbrel is a large, Holarctic, highly migratory shorebird. The North American race (N.p. hudsonicus) includes two disjunct breeding populations, both of which winter primarily in Central and South America. The western population breeds in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada. The eastern population breeds south and west of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and Ontario. The prevailing idea was that the western population followed a Pacific Coast migration route between breeding and wintering areas in Panama and western South America, and that the Hudson Bay population followed an Atlantic Coast migration route to wintering grounds in Northeast South America. Both populations are of high conservation concern due to population declines in recent decades. Investigations into the migration routes of whimbrels staging in Virginia have shown a previously unknown link between the eastern and western populations as they stop-over in Virginia. The primary objective of this project is to examine the stop-over and migration strategies of whimbrels, as they relate to the conservation of the species.

Given recent declines of long-distance migrant birds, multi-population tracking studies are crucial in order to assess the strength of migratory connectivity and to identify key sites en route. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of migration patterns and migratory connectivity in the globally near-threatened European roller Coracias garrulus.<br>
Location: Breeding area: Europe; passage area: Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula; wintering area: southern Africa<br>
Methods: We synthesise new geolocator data with existing geolocator, satellite tag and ring recovery data from eight countries across Europe. We describe routes and stopover sites, analyse the spatial pattern of winter sites with respect to breeding origin, and quantify the strength of connectivity between breeding and winter sites.<br>
Results: We demonstrate the importance of the northern savannah zone as a stopover region and reveal the easterly spring loop (via Arabia) and leap-frog migration of rollers from eastern populations. Whilst there was some overlap between individuals from different populations over winter, their distribution was non-random, with positive correlations between breeding and autumn/winter longitude as well as between pairwise distance matrices of breeding and winter sites. Connectivity was stronger for eastern populations than western ones.<br>
Main conclusions: The moderate levels of connectivity detected here may increase the resilience of breeding populations to localised habitat loss on the winter quarters. We also highlight passage regions crucial for the successful conservation of Roller populations, including the Sahel/Sudan savannah for all populations, and the Horn of Africa/Arabian Peninsula for north-eastern rollers.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,,,,Coracias garrulus,Solar Geolocator Raw,tom.finch (Tom Finch)

During stationary tests, microtopography and satellite geometry had the largest influence on GPS fix success rate (FSR) and location error (LE). There was no difference between FSR while animals wore the GPS collars above ground and FSR generated during stationary, above-ground trials, suggesting that animal behavior other than burrowing did not markedly influence micro-GPS errors. In our study, traditional micro-GPS receivers demonstrated similar FSR and LE to snapshot receivers, however, snapshot receivers operated inconsistently due to battery and software failures.

As a consequence of the links between biomes mediated by migrants, changes in one biome could affect remote areas in unpredictable ways. Migratory routes and timing of most Neotropical austral migrants, which breed at south temperate latitudes of South America and overwinter closer to or within tropical latitudes of South America, have yet to be described in detail. As a result, our understanding about how these birds provide links between South American biomes is almost non-existent. White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis) is a long-distance austral migrant that breeds in the Patagonian Forest biome and overwinters in tropical South America. Because this small flycatcher plays a key role in the regeneration of this ecosystem, our objective was to describe the annual cycle of White-crested elaenias to evaluate the degree of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering areas and therefore to determine if there are specific biomes of northern South America linked by elaenias to Patagonian forests. Fifteen individuals were successfully tracked throughout a complete migration cycle using miniature light-level geolocators. All individuals resided and moved through the same general regions. During fall (March-April-May), elaenias were located in the Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest biomes, from Rio de Janeiro to the region near Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. During winter (June-July-Aug), birds were located further inland, within the Cerrado biome. Birds used three different routes during fall migration. Our results indicate that some individuals use a direct route, flying between 500-600 km/day, crossing desert and grasslands, while others took a detour, flying 100-200 km/day through forested areas with refueling opportunities. All birds used the Yunga forest during spring migration, with ten out 15 individuals showing a clear counterclockwise loop trajectories throughout their annual cycle. None of the elaenias passed through Amazonia, traveled to western South America or crossed the Equator. Eleanias exhibited a high migratory connectivity between breeding area in Patagonian Forests and winter areas, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. Our results suggest that Patagonian Forests could be strongly impacted by changes in those biomes or in the Yungas.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2013-12-21 11:08:00.000,2015-10-06 17:32:00.000,7361,Elaenia albiceps,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw",sbravo (Susana Patricia Bravo)

Without such information, it is impossible to understand full annual cycle ecology and effectively implement conservation actions that address where and when populations are most limited. We deployed and recovered light-level geolocators (n = 34) at six breeding sites in North America across the breeding range of a declining long-distance migratory bird, the Prothonotary Warbler (
<i>Protonotaria citrea</i>). We sought to determine migratory routes, stopover location and duration, and the location of overwintering grounds. We found that the species exhibits a large-scale, east-west split in migratory routes and weak migratory connectivity across their range. Specifically, almost all individuals, regardless of breeding origin, overlapped in their estimated wintering location in northern Colombia, in an area 20% the size of the breeding range. Additionally, the majority of individuals across all breeding locations concentrated in well-defined stopover locations in Central America while en route to Colombia. While error inherent in light-level geolocation cannot be fully ruled out, surprisingly, much of the estimated wintering area included inland areas, despite the fact that Prothonotary Warblers are considered a specialist on coastal mangroves in winter. Based on these results, conservation efforts directed at very specific nonbreeding geographical areas will potentially have benefits across most of the breeding population. Our findings highlight the importance of using modern technologies to validate assumptions about little studied portions of species’ annual life cycles, and the need to distribute sampling across species ranges.

Bats used diverse flight strategies, but generally flew lower than 40 m, with scouting flights to 100 m and a maximum of 300 m. We found no influence of weather on height and high-altitude ascents were not preceded by an increase in foraging effort. Wingbeat frequency was independent from climbing or descending flight, and bats skipped wingbeats or glided in 10% of all observations. Wingbeat frequency was positively related to capture mass, and wingbeat frequency was positively related to time of night, indicating an effect of load increase over a foraging bout.

Flyways of 5 Openbills from 3 colonies were monitored using Argos satellite transmitters with positioning by Google Earth Programme version 7.1.5. The Openbills and domestic birds living in the vicinity were trapped during the breeding season each year to test for H5N1 HPAI virus infection. During the monitoring period, none of the Openbills tagged with satellite telemeters moved outside of Thailand. The movement of these Openbills did not correlate with H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in domestic poultry, but was correlated with rice crop rotation and populations of the apple snails which are their preferred food. Viral spread within the flocks of Openbills was not observed. This study showed that Openbills played no role in the spread of H5N1 HPAI virus, which was probably due to the very low prevalence of virus during the monitoring period.

musculus; four females, three males, one of unknown sex), and five fin whales (B.
physalus; two females, one male, two of unknown sex) off southern California, USA,
in summer 2014 and 2015. Tags logged 1-Hz data from tri-axial accelerometers,
magnetometers, and a depth sensor, while acquiring Fastloc GPS locations. Tag
attachment duration ranged from 18.3 to 28.9 d for blue whales and 4.9–16.0 d
for fin whales, recording 1,030–4,603 dives and 95–3,338 GPS locations per whale
across both species. Feeding lunges (identified from accelerometer data) were used
to characterize “feeding bouts” (i.e., sequences of feeding dives with <60 min of
consecutive non-feeding dives), within-bout behavior, and to examine the spatial
distribution of feeding effort. Whales fed near the tagging locations (Point Mugu and
San Miguel Island) for up to 7 d before dispersing as far south as Ensenada, Mexico,
and north to Cape Mendocino, California. Dispersal within southern California waters
differed by sex in both species with males undertaking offshore, circuitous excursions,
while females remained more coastal, suggesting that movement patterns on the feeding
grounds may not be exclusively related to energy gain. Feeding bout characteristics
were similar for both species, with the median bout having 24 dives and lasting 3.3 h
for blue whales (n = 242), and 19 dives while lasting 2.7 h for fin whales (n = 59). Bout
duration was positively correlated with the number of feeding lunges per dive within a
bout for both species, suggesting whales left poor-quality prey patches quickly but fed
intensively for up to 34.9 h when prey was abundant. Feeding bouts occurred further
apart as the distance from shore increased, but there was no corresponding difference
in the number of feeding lunges per dive, suggesting the whales were feeding at the
same rate throughout their range, but that prey was more dispersed in offshore waters.
This may be evidence of two feeding strategies, with spatially aggregated foraging around
highly localized, topographically forced upwelling centers nearshore, and more dispersed
foraging in larger areas of elevated, but patchy, productivity offshore.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-08-04 18:44:30.000,2015-08-06 20:34:53.000,17150,"Balaenoptera physalus,Balaenoptera musculus",GPS,tomasf (Tomas)

Please contact the data owner at wgetz@berkeley.edu for the full dataset. The relationship between resource availability and wildlife movement patterns is pivotal to understanding species behavior and ecology. Movement response to landscape variables occurs at multiple temporal scales, from sub-diurnal to multiannual. Additionally, individuals may respond to both current and past conditions of resource availability. In this paper, we examine the temporal scale and variation of current and past resource variables that affect movement patterns of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) using sub-hourly movement data from GPS-GSM collared elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We created detailed satellite-based spatiotemporal maps of vegetation biomass, as well as distance from surface water, road and fence. We used step selection functions to measure the relative importance of these landscape variables in determining elephants’ local movement patterns. We also examined how elephants respond to information, in locations they have previously visited, on productivity integrated over different temporal scales: from current to historical conditions. Our results demonstrate that elephants choose patches with higher-than average annual productivity and grass biomass, but lower tree biomass. Elephants also prefer to walk close to water, roads, and fences. These preferences vary with time of day and with season, thereby providing insights into diurnal and seasonal behavioral patterns and the ecological importance of the landscape variables examined. We also discovered that elephants respond more strongly to long-term patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions, in familiar locations. Our results illustrate how animals with high cognitive capacity and spatial memory integrate long-term information on landscape conditions. We illuminate the importance of long-term high temporal resolution satellite imagery to understanding the relationship between movement patterns and landscape structure.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2008-10-30 00:15:00.000,2014-03-27 17:40:00.000,99988,Loxodonta africana,GPS,wgetz (Wayne Getz)

Results: A tracked wood warbler migrated south-south-east to sub-Saharan Africa in Sudan and then west-south-west to winter in Côte d’Ivoire. The timing and route fits well within the distribution of ring recoveries although the westward movement after the Sahara crossing is not revealed by the ring recoveries, but only few recoveries south of Sahara exist.

Even in social species, it is unclear how migratory skills are transmitted from one generation to another and what implications this may have. Here we show that in Caspian terns Hydroprogne caspia family groups, genetic and foster male parents carry the main responsibility for migrating with young. During migration, young birds stayed close to an adult at all times, with the bond dissipating on wintering grounds. Solo-migrating adults migrated faster than did adults accompanying young. Four young that lost contact with their parent at an early stage of migration all died. During their first solo migration, subadult terns remained faithful to routes they took with their parents as young. Our results provide evidence for cultural inheritance of migration knowledge in a long-distance bird migrant and show that sex-biased (allo)parental care en route shape migration through social learning.

                           To grow, survive and reproduce under anthropogenic-induced changes, individuals must respond quickly and favourably to the surrounding environment. A species that feeds on a wide variety of prey types (i.e. generalist diet) may be comprised of generalist individuals, specialist individuals that feed on different prey types, or a combination of the two. If individuals within a population respond differently to an environmental change, population-level responses may not be detectable. By tracking foraging movements of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), a generalist species, we compared group-level and individual-level responses to an increase in prey biomass (capelin; Mallotus villosus) during the breeding season in coastal Newfoundland, Canada. As hypothesized, shifts in prey availability resulted in significantly different individual responses in foraging behaviour and space use, which was not detectable when data from individuals were combined. Some individuals maintained similar foraging areas, foraging trip characteristics (e.g., trip length, duration) and habitat use with increased capelin availability, while others shifted foraging areas and habitats resulting in either increased or decreased trip characteristics. We show that individual specialization can be non-contextual in some gulls, whereby these individuals continuously use the same feeding strategy despite significant change in prey availability conditions. Findings also indicate high response diversity among individuals to shifting prey conditions that a population- or group-level study would not have detected, emphasizing the importance of examining individual-level strategies for future diet and foraging studies on generalist species.

Foraging efficiency could also affect population dynamics, with increasing populations in places with minimized energetic costs and decreasing numbers in areas of increased foraging costs. Most studies of the foraging behaviour of animals have concentrated on the description of movements. However, the mechanisms underlying animal foraging behaviour remain mostly unexplained. Recent advances in animal movement tracking and data analyses have a great potential to fill this gap in our knowledge. With the use of accelerometers, features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable conditions can be translated into energetic costs of movement, which, in turn, can be viewed as energy landscapes. I propose to take advantage of the newly available technology and methods in order to reveal how variable foraging costs in different environments affect the performance of different population. I will use energy landscapes to study how an Antarctic predator has successfully adapted to recent environmental change. Using Gentoo penguins as a model species, I will study how foraging strategies differ between populations located in optimal (Antarctic Peninsula, increasing population) and suboptimal breeding sites (Falkland Islands, fluctuating populations). By comparing the use of energy landscapes, I will explore which conditions allow this species to maintain high levels of body condition and reproductive success and successfully expand in Antarctic sites. The results will also help to reveal how adapt to changing conditions, such as those expected under current climate change.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2017-01-08 15:37:41.000,2017-01-23 17:19:38.000,22784,Pygoscelis antarcticus,"GPS,Accessory Measurements",masello (Masello)

We captured long billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus; hereafter dowitchers) to study their molt patterns and length of stay in the Klamath Basin during fall migration and their migratory connectivity and overwinter space use in California’s Central Valley. Most dowitchers were in active primary molt when captured (83%, n=116), and molt stage increased during August and September. Radio-tagged dowitchers had an average length of stay after capture of 31.9 days (n¼54). After departing the Klamath Basin, we located 57% of 81 radio-tagged dowitchers in the Central Valley from December to February; most of the 228 detections occurred in the Sacramento Valley (39%) or Grasslands Ecological Area in the San Joaquin Basin (47%). Space use by radio-tagged dowitchers differed among the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Basin, and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta sub-regions, which demonstrated the influence of varying amounts and distributions of habitat. We recommend that managers in the Klamath Basin provide shallow-water wetlands to support migrant dowitchers for approximately 30 days beginning around 1 August, but ideally wetlands should be maintained until 30 September if freshwater supplies are available.

With increasing moonlight, they switch from flying above to flying underneath the forest canopy, possibly as a predator avoidance strategy. Interestingly, the foraged above open fields (grass, arable) more often when the moon was bright, proposing that predator avoidance played a rather minor role here. We propose that open-space foraging bats are highly flexible in their spatio-temporal habitat use, allowing them to exploit cyclic appearing insect swarms which may be lured into the open under bright moonlight conditions. Further, bats repeatedly flew at altitudes higher than 70 m above canopy or open fields.

At the western Mediterranean basin scale, fin whales were associated with the anticlockwise gyre in the northern part of the western Mediterranean Sea, which defines the habitat of krill, the whales' main prey. At mesoscale and submesoscale, and only during the seasonal phytoplankton biomass minimum in summer, whales exhibited a preference for the periphery of eddies and they were often associated with filaments indicative of submesoscale fronts. Timescales of these mesoscale and submesoscale features are comparable with the ecological timescales of the lower levels of the trophic chain. Whales were not associated to productive areas, probably due to the spatiotemporal lag between phytoplankton and krill.

There is little information on individual movements within breeding areas or migratory connections to feeding grounds. We sought to better understand humpback whale habitat use and movements at breeding areas off West Africa, and during the annual migration to Antarctic feeding areas. We also assessed potential overlap between whale habitat and anthropogenic activities. We used Argos satellite‐monitored radio tags to collect data on 13 animals off Gabon, a primary humpback whale breeding area. We quantified habitat use for 3 cohorts of whales and used a state‐space model to determine transitions in the movement behavior of individuals. We developed a spatial metric of overlap between whale habitat and models of cumulative human activities, including oil platforms, toxicants, and shipping. We detected strong heterogeneity in movement behavior over time that is consistent with previous genetic evidence of multiple populations in the region. Breeding areas for humpback whales in the eastern Atlantic were extensive and extended north of Gabon late in the breeding season. We also observed, for the first time, direct migration between West Africa and sub‐Antarctic feeding areas. Potential overlap of whale habitat with human activities was the highest in exclusive economic zones close to shore, particularly in areas used by both individual whales and the hydrocarbon industry. Whales potentially overlapped with different activities during each stage of their migration, which makes it difficult to implement mitigation measures over their entire range.

The objectives of this research are to identify distinctive grazing personalities in Hereford beef cattle and to test for genotype-to-phenotype associations of grazing behaviors. The approach proposes to take advantage of the natural and distinctive grazing personalities displayed by domesticated livestock; thus, rangelands’ health can be enhanced and the negative environmental impact of free-range livestock systems is reduced.
I am searching for cattle herds that explore and use the whole landscape using the individual differences on grazing behaviors of domesticated herbivores. By spreading livestock grazing pressure across grazing lands and minimizing the use of naturally rare and fragile areas such low herbaceous plant communities, free-range livestock systems enhance grassland functions and services and reduce negative impact of the environment. Using GPS-tracking collars and satellite image data, I observed the grazing behavior of Hereford beef cattle in a few farms in Canterbury, New Zealand.
For this project, I built 120 GPS-tracking collars outfitted with long-lasting batteries and large data storage capacity. During the first year, I conducted a longitudinal behavioral sampling by collaring fewer cows (ca. 80) and by recording grazing behavior for relatively long periods (30 to 90 days). In the second year, I collared a much larger number of cows for shorter periods in a cross-sectional behavioral sampling.
I collected blood samples from all animals with behavioral data to investigate the genetic variation of ‘grazing-related genes’. They aim is to combine the grazing behavioral data with their corresponding genetic profile to seek for genotype-to-phenotype associations within the Hereford breed.

This dataset corresponds to my first year of grazing behavior sampling (longitudinal data set) on Hereford cows. For more details, updates and related publications, please visit:

In February 2003, we deployed 11 Argos satellite‐monitored radio tags to track movements and surfacings of humpback whales (five adults without calves, five mothers with calves, one calf) off Socorro Island in the Revillagigedo Archipelago. Tracking ranged from 222 to 10,481 km over 4.9–149.1 d. Eight whales left Socorro Island: five visited other Mexican wintering destinations, seven moved north of these areas. Migration routes were primarily offshore (average 444 km). Two whales were tracked to feeding grounds: one to British Columbia (46 d migration), and one to Alaska (49 d migration). Mean travel speeds were 1.2 km/h in wintering areas, 4.0 km/h during migration, and 2.2 km/h in feeding areas. Overall surfacing rates ranged from 21 to 88 surfacings/h. Surfacing rates differed between the calf and all other whales, and between feeding areas and migratory/wintering areas for the calf and an adult without a calf. The calf also showed diel variation in surfacing rates.

Most coastwise movement on the south coast occurred in a westerly direction with cow‐calf pairs moving slowest. Three whales tagged on the west coast and one tagged on the south coast moved north into St Helena Bay, a probable feeding ground, where residence times were 36–100 d. Five animals tracked after leaving the coast maintained a bearing of 201°–220° before branching out over the southeast Atlantic from 37° to 60°S and between 13°W and 16°E, traveling 3,800–8,200 km over the ensuing 53–110 d before transmissions ceased. Their locations were categorized as migrating or nonmigrating based on the relative orientation of the track and net speed. An average of 42% of nonmigrating locations were between 37°S and 45°S, and 53% were south of 52°S, possibly associated with the Subtropical Convergence and Antarctic Polar Front, respectively. Whaling data suggest right whales fed largely on copepods at the former and euphausiids at the latter. If the nonmigrating locations represented feeding at these frontal zones, switching between them would seem to have obvious cost‐benefit implications.

To aid conservation of the northwestern population that utilizes the Barba Azul Nature Reserve during the non-breeding season, we set out to learn the sites where these birds breed using satellite telemetry. We describe preliminary tests conducted on captive birds (at Loro Parque Foundation, Tenerife, Spain) that resulted in choosing Geotrak Parrot Collars, a metal, battery-operated unit that provides data through the Argos satellite system. In September 2019, we tagged three birds in Barba Azul with Geotrak collars, and received migration data for two birds, until battery depletion in November and December 2019. Our two migrant birds were tracked leaving Barba Azul on the same date (27 September), but departed in divergent directions (approximately 90 degrees in separation). They settled in two sites approximately 50–100 km from Barba Azul. Some details of the work are restricted out of conservation concern as the species still faces poaching pressures. Knowing their likely breeding grounds, reserve managers conducted site visits to where the birds were tracked, resulting in the discovery of breeding birds, although no birds still carrying a transmitter were seen then. A single individual still carrying its collar was spotted 13 August 2021 at Barba Azul. The work suggests that the Blue-throated Macaws of Barba Azul use breeding sites that are scattered across the Llanos de Moxos region, although within the recognized boundaries of the northwestern subpopulation. We conclude that the use of satellite collars is a feasible option for research with the species and could provide further conservation insights.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2019-08-31 22:23:48.000,2019-12-27 01:55:22.000,514,Ara glaucogularis,Argos Doppler Shift,LisaD (Lisa Davenport)

Here, GPS loggers were used to track chick-rearing Cassin’s auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) at their largest breeding colony, located on Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada (50°51′35″N; 129°4′34″W). Analyses were conducted at both the individual and population level to assess whether inter-annual variation in habitat use (2014, 2015, and 2017) could be explained by dynamic oceanographic features, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a concentrations, or by static bathymetric features. At both scales of analyses, the foraging behaviour of Cassin’s auklets was most strongly influenced by SST. At the individual level, birds spent more time foraging in areas with lower SST, relative to other areas visited over the course of a foraging trip. At the population level, the at-sea distribution of Cassin’s auklets varied across years, with birds using areas northwest of colony in 2014 and areas west of the colony in 2015 and 2017. Furthermore, the probability of foraging across the study area was higher in areas with lower SST, suggesting that SST influences the broad-scale foraging distribution of Cassin’s auklets. Identification of the environmental drivers of habitat use across multiple years can be used to help in predicting suitable at-sea habitat across time, leading to more effective conservation management.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2014-05-20 03:44:00.000,2017-05-22 06:12:00.000,4184,Ptychoramphus aleuticus,GPS,hipfnerm (Mark Hipfner)

We used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to identify three movement behaviour states from track characteristics, which we classified as transit, resting and foraging. Immersion data collected from the GPS tags allowed us to differentiate between the two slow-moving states, and confidently identify foraging movement behaviour. Validation of movement behaviour states using time of day and immersion data suggested HMMs successfully identified daytime foraging locations, although nighttime socializing or resting may have been misclassified as foraging. Our results can inform marine conservation of this vulnerable species by differentiating foraging from other at-sea movement behaviours, and is a first step to identifying critical foraging habitat.

We collected tissue samples for genetic analyses on five breeding colonies in the western Pacific Ocean (Japan) and on 13 colonies in the eastern Pacific Ocean (California to Alaska), and deployed light-level geolocator tags on 12 eastern Pacific colonies to delineate wintering areas. Geolocator tags were deployed previously on one colony in Japan. There was strong genetic differentiation between populations in the eastern vs. western Pacific Ocean, likely due to two factors. First, glaciation over the North Pacific in the late Pleistocene might have forced a southward range shift that historically isolated the eastern and western populations. And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (FꞌST)was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2014-05-15 19:00:34.000,2017-05-04 19:01:36.000,45450,Cerorhinca monocerata,"Solar Geolocator,Accessory Measurements,Solar Geolocator Raw",vpattison (Vivian Pattison)

Recent mining related infrastructure development, if not carefully managed, could fragment the range of this nomadic species in Mongolia, a range-limiting effect that occurred previously, e.g. in the 1950s, with the development of the trans-Mongolian railroad. With an estimated 35,000 individuals, the SE Gobi houses >60% of the global Asiatic wild ass population. Consequently, its conservation is of regional, national, and international importance, making the Mongolian khulan a flagship species for biodiversity conservation in the Gobi. The goal of the khulan collaring project is to monitor space use and movement patterns, focusing on the impact of mining-related infrastructure and associated habitat fragmentation. The data are intended to: 1) Measure and quantify impact of the OT mine and other infrastructure on khulan movements (which includes obtaining baseline values of certain movement parameters), 2) Identify critical khulan habitat, 3) Optimize the placement and design of mitigation measures that will help khulan cross these barriers, and 4) Identify suitable offset measures in the greater offset landscape.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2013-08-23 11:00:00.000,2019-08-28 23:00:00.000,771989,Equus hemionus,GPS,kaczensky (Petra Kaczensky)

To investigate little known aspects of their annual cycle, breeding common sandpipers were fitted with geolocators to track their migrations and determine their non‐breeding areas. Ten tagged birds left Scotland on 9 July (median dates and durations are given throughout the abstract). Short‐term staging was carried out by some birds in England and Ireland, then for longer by most birds in Iberia before continuing to West Africa, arriving on 28 July. Six birds spent most of the non‐breeding season (October–February) on the coast of Guinea‐Bissau, suggesting that this is a key area. Single birds occurred in Sierra Leone, Guinea, the Canary Islands and Western Sahara. The southward migration from Scotland took 17.5 days (range 1.5‐24 days), excluding the initial fuelling period. The first northward movement from Africa was on 12 April. Staging occurred in either Morocco, Iberia or France. Arrival in Scotland was on 2 May. The northward migration took 16 days (range 13.5‐20.5 days). The main migration strategy involved short‐ and medium‐range flights, using tail‐winds in most cases. Variation in strategy was associated with departure date; birds that left later staged for shorter durations. Coastal West Africa provides two major habitats for common sandpipers: mudflats associated with mangroves and rice fields. Although the area of mangrove has been depleted, the scale of loss has probably been insufficient to account for the decline in sandpiper numbers. Rice fields are expanding, providing feeding areas for water‐birds. Meteorological data during the migrations suggest that the weather during the southward migration is unlikely to contribute to a population decline but strong cross‐winds or head‐winds during the northward migration to the breeding grounds may do so.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,,,,Actitis hypoleucos,Solar Geolocator Raw,Louise.de-Raad (Dr. Louise de Raad)

Summary
1. Tracking return migrations in songbirds has been impossible until recently when miniaturization of light-level loggers enabled observation of the first complete round trip. Although geolocators are extensively used on animals at sea, little is known about how accurate geolocators are for tracking terrestrial or forest-dwelling migrants.
2. To test the accuracy of geolocators for tracking migratory songbirds living in forested habitat, we calibrated geolocators to a source population located in central Europe and collected location estimates based on the source population calibration from stationary geolocators deployed over an 800 km NE to SW gradient in Western Europe. Additionally, we fit non-migratory songbirds (European blackbirds, Turdus merula) with geolocators for 12 months to compare known locations of individuals with locations estimated by geolocators.
3. We found an average error ±95% CI of 201 ± 43 km in latitude for stationary geolocators in forest habitat. Longitude error was considerably lower (12 ± 03 km). The most accurate geoloca- tor was on average 23 km off target, the worst was on average 390 km off. 
4. The winter latitude estimate error for geolocators deployed on sedentary birds was on average (±95% CI) 143 ± 62 km when geolocators were calibrated during the breeding season and 132 ± 75 km when they were calibrated during the winter. Longitude error for geolocators deployed on birds was on average (±95% CI) 50 ± 34 km.
5. Although we found error most likely due to seasonal changes in habitat and behaviour, our results indicate that geolocators can be used to reliably track long-distance forest-dwelling migrants. We also found that the low degree of error for longitude estimates attained from geolocators makes this technology suitable for identifying relatively short-distance movements in longitude.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw",sarahcd (Sarah Davidson (curator))

Miniature light-level geolocators provide new opportunities to follow passerines throughout their annual cycle. We used this technology to follow the annual movements of Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a rare, range-restricted passerine that breeds in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada and winters in the Greater Antilles. We found that thrush departure from breeding sites was remarkably synchronized range-wide, with most individuals leaving during the first week of October. The mean duration of fall migration (29 ± 10 d) was significantly longer than spring migration (17 ± 4.3 d). A lengthy fall stopover (6 to 33 d) detected for at least half of the birds in the Bahamas contributed to this temporal delay. Eighteen of 19 thrushes with geolocators fitted on breeding grounds likely overwintered on Hispaniola. Three thrushes that carried geolocators through two consecutive annual cycles showed little variation in overwinter locations, with inter-annual locations ranging between 0.25 - 0.58 degrees latitude for each bird. Our finding that Bicknell’s Thrushes stop over on their southbound migration near their wintering grounds, likely in the Bahamas, represents the first information on migratory stopover of this species, and suggests an important avenue for future research and conservation.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-06-04 03:02:59.000,2011-07-10 10:09:36.000,12510,Catharus bicknelli,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Twilight",kpmcfarland (Kent McFarland)

While many species are unable to adapt to these human-made environments, some species not only survive but thrive in urban landscapes. The West European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus is a species of conservation concern in the United Kingdom where populations have declined markedly since the 1950s. Despite declines being reported both in urban and rural areas, the species seems to be persisting in cities and towns. However, current population estimates are unreliable and our understanding of the population status of the species is limited. This study aimed to understand how hedgehogs respond to urbanisation by investigating how their density, movement behaviour and habitat selection varies across urban and rural landscapes.
Between 2016 and 2019, camera trapping and high-frequency GPS movement data were collected across England. Hedgehog densities were calculated from camera trapping data using the Random Encounter Model (REM) across five urban and four rural study sites, and compared to those estimated by Spatially Capture-Recapture using data from nocturnal spotlight surveys. Hedgehog movement was studied across five urban and six rural sites, where home range was evaluated using the Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) method. Movement behaviour was extracted from GPS data using Hidden Markov Models, incorporated into habitat selection analysis and studied using the integrated step selection analysis.
Hedgehog density, as estimated by the REM, was on average 7.5 times higher in urban versus rural landscapes. The movement of individual hedgehogs differed between both landscapes: urban individuals exhibited slower speeds and travelled shorter distances per night than rural individuals. Nightly home range size was best predicted by sex, landscape and the proportion of gardens used: larger home ranges were displayed by males in the rural landscape, and home range sizes decreased as the proportion of gardens used increased. Hedgehogs spent more time foraging (68%) than travelling (32%) across both landscapes. However, the time spent performing each behaviour varied by sex and landscape. Gardens were found to be important habitats, as they were strongly selected for foraging and travelling behaviours of hedgehogs in both urban and rural areas.
v
This is the first comparative study to estimate population densities across urban and rural areas in England and provide researchers with a robust methodology that uses camera trapping data and the REM for the monitoring of species. Furthermore, this is the first study to incorporate behaviour extracted from GPS movement data into habitat selection analysis to better understand how hedgehogs are using different habitats in different landscapes. Findings from this study provide important and novel information to aid understanding of how different landscapes are affecting the distribution and behaviour of hedgehogs and how they are exploiting anthropogenic landscape features to persist in cities and towns.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2016-05-17 22:50:00.000,2018-07-15 22:25:00.000,20528,,GPS,antoniouzal (Antonio Uzal Fernandez)

In the 1990s radio-tagging Common Buzzards advanced our knowledge of raptor dispersal and survival, leading to a better understanding of population structures. However, conventional radio-tracking required prolonged and extensive periods of fieldwork. Despite SW working full time on the project, the most frequently an individual could be located was a few times per week, and there were times when individuals could not be found, leading to many unanswered questions. 

With recent advances in technology we now have GPS satellite tags that can provide many locations a day to be downloaded remotely without the physical tracking labour. Therefore, it is time to add detail and better understand dispersal decisions in juvenile Common Buzzards. More frequent locations would improve the detail of large movements, increasing relocation sample size and allow greater interpretation of what influences the dispersal of individuals. For example, although we established that weather influenced when Buzzards dispersed and then how far they dispersed, we had to make assumptions related to a 5-day weather window and how directly they travelled between their natal area and their dispersed location. Likewise, assessing the areas where Buzzards dispersed to could only be determined from where they settled. Nothing could be said about what had been rejected along the dispersal path, because the exact path was unknown.

Using Common Buzzards as the study species has several advantages:

1)They are relatively common, ensuring larger sample sizes and not risking detrimental effects on individuals from rarer species.

2)There is previous radio-tracking data to compare the more detailed GPS data with. This provides an ability to test some of the assumptions of previous research and potentially allows a way to interpret radio-tracking data from the past.

GAMMs showed that temperature, time of the day and Julian date explained variation in display behaviour within the day, with birds snort-calling significantly less during higher temperatures. We also showed that variation in daily snort-call activity was related to average daytime temperatures, with our model predicting an average decrease in daytime snort-call display activity of up to 10.4% for the temperature increases projected by 2100 in this region due to global warming.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,,,,Tetrax tetrax,Acceleration,jpsilva (Joao Paulo Silva)

S. population’s migration pathway was much different and ended much farther away - over 8,000 kilometers - than had been imagined. By 2005, we had combined this dramatic new remote-sensing technology with direct VHF radio tracking in South America to confirm consistent annual movements over Gulf and Caribbean waters, Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, eastern Central America, and around South America’s Amazon Basin to wintering sites in the heterogeneous landscape of southern Brazil and nearby Bolivia. In 2011, to identify year-round habitat needs and range areas, determine critical breeding areas, estimate annual survival, and investigate migration and wintering threats,  we began deploying the smallest ever GPS-equipped satellite transmitters. These devices provide up to eight locations each day, accurate to within 15 meters, for several years. This collaborative project with Dr. Jennifer Coulson was made possible by funding from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by Microwave Telemetry’s unscheduled development of a satellite/GPS unit small enough to be carried by a Swallow-tailed Kite. Such data will enable us to refine management recommendations and intensify conservation efforts where most needed throughout the Swallow-tailed Kites year-round range.

Yet, human-modified habitats can provide resources, resulting in selection of disturbed areas by generalist species. To investigate spatial and temporal responses of a generalist carnivore to human disturbance, we investigated habitat selection and diel activity patterns in caracals (Caracal caracal). We GPS-collared 25 adults and subadults in urban and wildland-dominated subregions in Cape Town, South Africa. Selection responses for landscape variables were dependent on subregion, animal age class, and diel period. Contrary to expectations, caracals did not become more nocturnal in urban areas. Caracals increased their selection for proximity to urban areas as the proportion of urban area increased. Differences in habitat selection between urban and wildland caracals suggest that individuals of this generalist species exhibit high behavioral flexibility in response to anthropogenic disturbances that emerge as a function of habitat context.

As reported previously, following HF lesion, a low spatio-temporal resolution analysis revealed that homing pigeons fly less direct paths home once near the loft. We now further show that 1) HF-lesioned pigeons are less likely to display fidelity to a particular flight path home when released from the same locations multiple times, 2) intact pigeons are more likely to exploit leading-line landscape features, e.g., a road or the border of a woodlot, in developing flight-path fidelity and 3) even when flying a straight path HF-lesioned homing pigeons are more likely to display relatively rapid, oscillatory heading changes as if casting about for sensory, presumably visual information. The flight behaviour differences between the intact and HF-lesioned pigeons persisted across the four releases from the three locations, although the differences became smaller with increasing experience. Taken together, the GPS-track data offer a detailed characterisation of the effects of HF lesion on landscape-based, homing pigeon navigation, offering new insight into the role of the hippocampal formation in supporting memory-related, e.g., fidelity to a familiar route home, and perhaps perceptual-related, e.g., oscillating headings, navigational processes.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2019-07-11 08:56:18.000,2019-08-29 11:49:16.000,1176650,Columba livia,GPS,anna (Anna Gagliardo)

This species was discovered in the wild just 34 years ago at Raso da Catarina, within the Caatinga biome of NE Brazil. Its distribution is restricted to five localities, separated by 34-50 km, where birds nest and roost communally in large cliffs and fragmented forests of rural areas. After the protection of two of these sites, thus reducing nest poaching and illegal trade, the population has grown in recent decades to reach 1,125 individuals in 2010. This moved to download the species from Critically Endangered to Endangered in the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2012). However, a recent assessment revealed that more than ca. 80% of the population is composed by non-breeding birds, as it is expected in a long-lived species with deferred maturity, suggesting it should listed again as Critically Endangered following IUCN criteria (Pacífico et al. 2014). A large research effort has been devoted in recent years to reveal the breeding biology of the species (Pacífico 2011, Pacífico et al. 2013), by accessing to the nests sited in cliffs. However, very few are known on most aspects of the species’ population ecology that are keys to design effective conservation actions. These macaws mostly feed on the fruit of the licuri palm (Syagrus coronata), but also on the fruits of other native Caatinga plants and on corn crops. Corn predation by macaws has caused their persecution by local farmers, to the point that a compensatory program is conducted to alleviate the farmer-macaw conflict (IUCN 2012). The patchy distribution and scarcity of licuri palms due to human and goat overexploitation might force macaws to move large distances to gain access to food, thus switching to consume nearby corn crops. However, the foraging habitat selection and related movements performed to satisfy daily energy requirements are virtually unknown in this species. These requirements, as well as food availability, could change seasonally and depending on the status of individuals. In this sense, the large population fraction composed by non-breeding birds may differ in both energy requirements and movement patterns from breeding birds. Apart from leaving reproductive energetic constraints, non-breeding birds are not attached to nesting sites and thus could made nomadic movements looking for distant but more abundant food resources. Remote tracking arises as a necessary tool to answer the above questions, related to habitat and space requirements, food shortage, agriculture conflict and seasonal movements. Moreover, it would help to delineate the actual area of occupancy of the species, identifying the most important foraging grounds now lacking protection, and even areas (or even populations) so far unknown for the species. We must consider the Caatinga covers ca. 1 million of km2 (Leal et al. 2005), most of them being rather inaccessible or poorly prospected. In fact, recent surveys confirmed a couple of Lear’s macaws distant 250 km from the two known breeding sites, that represents a functionally extinct population, and thus there is the hope that tagged birds could reveal new populations or at least important areas for the species.

We studied the annual migration schedules of European nightjar, a large nocturnal insectivore and compared it with two other larger migratory insectivores, common swift and common cuckoo. All species breed in North Europe and winter in sub-Saharan Africa, but estimating their spatiotemporal non-breeding distributions from observations is complicated by the occurrence of similar local African species. We used geolocators to track the annual migrations of nightjars and swifts and compared these with satellite tracking of cuckoo migration. Individuals of the three species migrated to wintering grounds centered in Central Africa, except some common swifts that remained in West Africa, crossing or circumventing the Sahara along different routes in spring and fall. Overall, all species showed similar regional and seasonal use of several stopover areas during migration. Among the three species, European nightjars and common cuckoos showed the most similar spatiotemporal migration patterns. The nightjars wintered in SW Central Africa and breeding and wintering made up by far the two longest stationary periods. Swifts were generally more mobile, and some individuals progressively visited areas further east in East Africa during winter and further west in West Africa on spring migration; this species also spent less time on stopovers, but more on wintering areas. Cuckoos were intermediate in their extent of movements. The speed of nightjar spring migration was equal to that of fall migration, in contrast to the two other species where spring return to breeding areas was faster. Ecological requirements are potentially useful for understanding spatiotemporal migration patterns and causes of declines in migratory species.",research,true,false,true,false,False,na,2010-06-30 23:00:00.000,2012-05-25 23:00:00.000,3099,Apus apus,Solar Geolocator,SigneAgermose (Signe Agermose Mathiasen Andersen)

Assessed yield loss on agricultural grassland relates non-linearly to goose grazing pressure",185,185,185,,,,"1.	In recent decades, conflict between geese and agriculture has increased. Management practices to limit this conflict include concentrating geese in protected areas, or population reduction. To justify such management, we need to understand their effects on goose-related damages, which requires an understanding of how damage is influenced by goose numbers and species interactions.
2.	We combined data from monthly goose counts and GPS-tracked geese to estimate grazing pressures by barnacle, white-fronted, and greylag geese on agricultural grasslands in Fryslân, the Netherlands. Using linear mixed models, we related this to damages assessed by professional inspectors. 
3.	Our results show a positive non-linear relationship between assessed damage and barnacle goose grazing pressure, where assessed damage increases with a decelerating rate as grazing pressure increases. For white-fronted geese, we find a negative relationship, while for greylag geese both positive and negative relationships occur. For each species, the relationship is influenced by the abundance of the other two.
4.	For barnacle geese, the relationship can be explained by selection of fields offering the best balance between food intake and energy expenditure, and by grass regrowth, with the highest grazing pressures occurring over a longer time period or when grass growth rates are highest. The results for the other two species are likely due to spatial and temporal differences in foraging preferences compared to barnacle geese, with the larger species avoiding areas with highest damages.
5.	Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that herbivore population reduction may not directly translate into decreases in agricultural damages and should be used with care. Management aimed at concentrating geese in refuges could help to alleviate farmer-goose conflicts, though further studies are required to determine actual damage reduction. We also find that not all goose species contribute equally to agricultural damage; care should be taken to ensure wildlife management targets the right species.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2016-01-01 00:00:00.000,2020-05-31 23:45:00.000,479828,"Branta leucopsis,Anser albifrons,Anser anser",GPS,Nbuitendijk (Nelleke Buitendijk)

The most recent goitered gazelle population survey suggest there are about 84,163 (95% CI 64,182 – 107,140) individuals across 116,160 km2 area in the Southern Gobi region, which represents over 80% of the global population. The footprint of the extractive industry and associated development of linear infrastructure in the region has the potential to negatively affect the movement patterns and distribution of goitered gazelle. This multiyear study is designed to assess how environmental (resource availability or NDVI, precipitation, and temperature) and human factors such as mining and associated infrastructures are influencing habitat use, range sizes, and cumulative annual movement distances of goitered gazelles. During 2014-2021, we successfully captured and collared a total of 50 goitered gazelles in the region and currently (as of September 2022) 16 animals are being tracked.

Such an adaptation should allow animals to reduce the cost of having a larger home range in areas with relatively low food availability. We studied how space and refuge use varied with local food availability in the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), a refuge-inhabiting rodent. We tested whether agoutis living in areas of relatively low food availability had larger home ranges, and whether this response was accompanied by an increase in the number of refuges used. We monitored agoutis in areas with contrasting densities of their principal food source the black palm (Astrocaryum standleyanum). We used both automated and manual radio telemetry to measure space use during the day and refuge use at night. Agoutis living in areas of low food availability had larger home ranges. All individuals used multiple refuges and the number of refuges was not correlated with home range size. Consequently, agoutis that had larger home ranges were forced to roam farther from their nearest refuge to find food. Our results do not support the hypothesis that prey animals use more refuges as they forage across a larger area. Agoutis with large home ranges and low-quality habitat should therefore face an elevated predation risk because they have to spend more time traveling, more time foraging, and are farther away from refuges on average. We hypothesize that agoutis, regardless of their home range size, use multiple refuges to reduce predictability to predators or reduce parasite loads.

The Eurasian Griffon vulture is among the largest raptors in Europe. It feeds exclusively on dead mammals. The species had been reintroduced in Southern Alps in 1996 and it is still in the process of colonization of the Alps.
This study aims at investigating flight behaviour of Eurasian griffon vultures in European moutains. We deployed in December 2014-Jan 2016 7 units from e-obs (GPS-GSM-GPRS) to 7 adults. the loggers are programmed to record tracks with high resolution (1Hz) coupled with accelerometer to record body posture. The tracks are also used to analyse how vultures use space according to seasons, how does it overlap human landscape and obstacles (power lines), and how and where do they find carcasses (at feeding stations or in alpine meadows).",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2015-01-13 14:30:06.000,2023-09-14 13:33:55.000,13538404,Gyps fulvus,"GPS,Acceleration",duriez (Olivier Duriez)

Large, avian migrants that fly in V-formations were proposed do so for energy saving by the use of up-wash by following individuals and regularly change leadership. As groups have been rather homogeneous in previous work, we aimed to explore leadership and its flight mechanics consequences in an extremely heterogeneous case of social migration, namely in spring migration of goose families. In families the experience of group members differs strongly and inclusive fitness may be important. We successfully collected overlapping spring migration tracking data of a complete family of greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons) and extracted leadership, flapping frequency and wind conditions in flight. Our data revealed V-formations where one parent was flying in front at all times. Although the father led the family group most of the time, he did not flap at higher frequency while doing so. In contrast, the mother flapped faster when leading, possibly because she experienced less supportive wind conditions than when the father led. We argue that in heterogeneous, social groups leadership might be fixed and not costly if supportive environmental conditions like wind can be used.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2015-03-20 00:00:06.000,2015-06-30 23:31:08.000,955487,Anser albifrons,GPS,andreakoelzsch (Andrea K&ouml;lzsch)

Consumer fireworks during New Year (NY) are widely distributed in W-Europe and cause strong disturbances that are known to incur stress responses in animals.

We show that, in parallel with particulate matter increases, during the night of NY geese flew on average 5 - 16 km further and 40 - 150 m higher, and more often shifted to new roost sites than on previous nights. This was also true during the 2020/21 fireworks ban, despite fireworks activity being reduced. Likely to compensate for extra flight costs, most geese moved less and increased their feeding activity in the following days.

To study non-breeding ecology and migration of the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor), we observed, captured, and GPS-tagged individuals at Reserva Natural Rincón de Santa Marí­a, an Important Bird Area on the Paraná River in Corrientes, Argentina, from 2017 to 2022 (237 captures, 95 individuals, 556 GPS fixes from 8 females). Common Nighthawks arrived at the reserve (late November to mid-January) partway through flight feather molt; primaries 8, 9, and 10 molted consecutively until early February, followed by body feathers. Three tagged females spent December/January to March at the reserve, May to August in Florida (USA), and October/November to December/January in the Cerrado (Brazil), and at least one traveled 1800 km while molting P8. Recapture rates across seasons were 44% for females and 25% for males. Small body size and breeding locations in Florida are consistent with the chapmani subspecies previously recorded from Argentina. Direct observations and GPS tracking (8 individuals) revealed that nighthawks roosted during the day in mature exotic pines; foraged over pines and native grasslands for 26–41 min within ~40 min after sunset, nearly always in silence; and rested for the remainder of the night in native grasslands, on roads, or on rocky platforms. Common Nighthawks should be included among the growing number of migratory species that exhibit long-distance movements between stationary sites during their long non-breeding period. Our results also suggest site fidelity to non-breeding areas, a continuous molt-migration strategy, and some nuanced migratory connectivity. Programs aiming to conserve long-distance migratory aerial insectivores should support long-term monitoring led from the Global South, especially in the Cerrado and southern South America.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2019-01-18 06:00:11.000,2020-10-22 15:00:11.000,110,Chordeiles minor,GPS,kristinacockle (Kristina Cockle)

USA",,,"The Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) was established as a National Conservation Area because it contained the most significant aggregation of nesting raptors, principally Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus), in North America. The legislation establishing the NCA requires that management of the area be based, in part, on research conducted there. Prairie Falcons use the NCA for only part of the year. Little was known about movement patterns between breeding and non-breeding areas, and even less was known about the extent of interchange among nesting populations. To determine if Prairie Falcon population declines might be related to conditions/factors in areas used during the non-nesting season, additional information was needed on behavior, habitat use, and mortality of Prairie Falcons during the non-breeding season. Specific objectives of this study were to: (1) characterize annual long-range movement patterns of female Prairie Falcons that nest in the NCA, (2) identify areas used by Prairie Falcons during the non-nesting season, and (3) assess breeding dispersal patterns of female Prairie Falcons.
From 1999–2003, we tracked movements of adult female Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus) using satellite telemetry to characterize long-range movement patterns and
breeding dispersal. We radio marked 40 falcons from April–May on their nesting grounds
in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwest Idaho. All falcons
with functioning transmitters left the Snake River Canyon from late June through mid-July.
Most headed northeast across the Continental Divide to summering areas in Montana, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Dakotas. Prairie Falcons stayed at their northern summer areas
for 1–4 months before heading to the southern Great Plains or to southwest Idaho. The
Great Plains was a key migration pathway. Important wintering areas included the Texas
Panhandle and southwest Idaho. Most falcons completed their seasonal migrations within 2
weeks. Use of widely separated nesting, summering, and wintering areas appears to be a
strategy to exploit seasonally abundant prey resources. Most falcons had three or fewer use
areas during the nonbreeding season, and falcons showed a high degree of fidelity to their
use areas during each season. At least 21 falcons returned to nest within 2.5 km of where
they nested in the previous year, but one falcon moved to a new nesting area 124 km south
of her previous breeding area. Prairie Falcon movements suggest large-scale connectivity of
grassland and shrubsteppe landscapes throughout western North America. Conservation of
Prairie Falcons must be an international effort that considers habitats used during both
nesting and non-nesting seasons.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,1999-04-17 01:29:54.000,2003-09-28 03:18:03.000,10306,Falco mexicanus,Argos Doppler Shift,kochert (Michael N. Kochert)

",jim.roth@umanitoba.ca,,"Background: Range expansion of species, a major consequence of climate changes, may alter communities substantially due to competition between expanding and native species. 
Methods: We first quantified size differences between an expanding habitat generalist, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and a circumpolar habitat specialist, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), at the edge of the Arctic, where climate-related changes occur rapidly, to predict the likelihood of the larger competitor escalating interference to intraguild killing. We then used satellite telemetry to evaluate competition in a heterogeneous landscape by examining space use early during the foxes' reproductive period, when resource scarcity, increased-food requirements and spatial constraints likely exacerbate the potential for interference. We used time-LoCoH to quantify space and habitat use, and Minta's index to quantify spatio-temporal interactions between neighbors.
Results: Our morphometric comparison involving 236 foxes found that the potential for escalated interference between these species was high due to intermediate size difference. Our results from 17 collared foxes suggested that expanding and native competitors may coexist when expanding species occur at low densities. Low home-range overlap between neighbors suggested territoriality and substantial exploitation competition for space. No obvious differential use of areas shared by heterospecific neighbors suggested low interference. If anything, intraspecific competition between red foxes may be stronger than interspecific competition. Red and Arctic foxes used habitat differentially, with near-exclusive use of forest patches by red foxes and marine habitats by Arctic foxes.
Conclusion: Heterogeneous landscapes may relax interspecific competition between expanding and native species, allowing exclusive use of some resources. Furthermore, the scarcity of habitats favored by expanding species may emphasize intraspecific competition between newcomers over interspecific competition, thus creating the potential for self-limitation of expanding populations. Dominant expanding competitors may benefit from interference, but usually lack adaptations to abiotic conditions at their expansion front, favoring rear-edge subordinate species in exploitation competition. However, due to ongoing climate change, systems are usually not at equilibrium. A spread of habitats and resources favorable to expanding species may promote higher densities of antagonistically dominant newcomers, which may lead to extirpation of native species.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2017-05-09 00:00:00.000,2020-06-15 18:00:00.000,12840,"Vulpes vulpes,Vulpes lagopus",GPS,Churchill Fox Project (Chloé Warret Rodrigues)

Our complete dataset contains both archival light-level geolocators (Integeo model P65C2-7, Migratetech, 7mm light pipe) and two successful GPS tags (Pinpoint-10, Lotek).  Deployments and recoveries occurred over 5 field seasons in central and southcentral Alaska.  Total individuals represented in the data: n = 16 (13 males, 3 females; 14 geos, 2 GPS).  Females: n= 2 geos (K648, Q335), n=1 GPS (Pinpoint 881).  Note:   Pinpoint 881 Fix #2 and Fix #3 are not deemed reliable.  Males: n=12 geos (all other geos), n=1 GPS (Pinpoint 869).  Pinpoint 869: All fixes = good.  Note Pinpoint-869 fixes 5,6,7,8 are all clustered on a wintering territory (known to occur in this species). Three birds in this dataset provided two years of data.  The first bird carried a single geolocator that functioned for two years (K288-- each year of data is provided separately).  Two other birds were geolocator re-deploys.  A second bird carried K659 in year 1 and Q330 in year 2.  It exhibited a 1.5cm open skin wound under the geo upon recovery in year 2.  We therefore advise cautious interpretation of Q330 data, as some migratory behavior may have been impacted by its injury.  The third bird carried K660 in year 1 and S050 in year 2. Both years of data from this bird are good!

Thus, we selected two study areas with differences habitats in order to tag lesser and common kestrels and compare their movements, hunting strategies, energy expenditure, prey and habitat selection. We used high temporal and spatial resolution bio-loggers. So far, three papers have been published using these data: 1) Sarà et al. (2019).

External factors such as geography and weather strongly affect birds’ migration influencing daily travel schedules and flight speed. For strictly thermal-soaring migrants, typically large birds, weather explains most seasonal and regional differences in speed. Smaller-sized flight generalists, which alternate between soaring and flapping flight, are expected to be less dependent on weather, and daily travel schedules are likely to be strongly influenced by geography and internal drivers, such as sex. We GPS-tracked the migratory flights of 70 lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni), to estimate the relative importance of external (wind and geography), internal factors (sex) and season, and to what extent do they explain variation in migration metrics, namely speed, distance, and travel duration. Our results show that nocturnal travel, tailwind and geography are determinant in explaining variation in migration metrics. We fine that wind strength explained most of the seasonal difference in migration speed. In both seasons, lesser kestrels sprinted across ecological barriers and frequently migrated during day and night, while travelling at a slower pace and mainly during the day when not flying over barriers. Our results highlight that external far outweighed internal factors and season in explaining variation in migration performance of a flight generalist, despite its ability to switch between flight-modes.

Kondrakova et al.,24,24,24,,,,"In this research, we analyzed the daily distances and maximum displacements of the Common crane (Grus grus) in the pre-migration period. Both metrics of daily movements were calculated using GPS telemetry data. We controlled for weather conditions (average daily temperature, daily precipitation, and wind speed), age, and the presence of offspring on crane daily movements. The study was conducted at pre-migration staging areas in the European part of Russia. We found no differences in daily movement distance between adults with and without chicks and subadults individuals. A positive relationship of daily distances and maximum displacements on the speed of the wind and a negative one on the average daily temperature and precipitation was displayed. . The influence of weather conditions on movement patterns can further affect the quality of migration in the rapidly changing climate.

of our project is to better understand the movement of biodiversity, both hosts and pathogens, in an
urban food web and to teach students and the broader public about biodiversity in their local
neighbourhoods . To undertake this ambitious project we have compiled a multidisciplinary team from
key local organisations, including NGRREC, SLU, WashU, StlZoo, and Forest Park Forever. We anticipate
our project will advance scientific theory, improve management of urban biodiversity, and inspire St.
Louisans and others to a deeper wonder of and care for biodiversity. We are requesting funding from
LEC to address four objectives:
1. Attach biologgers to 2-5 individuals of 12 focal vertebrates that span trophic levels and aquatic,
terrestrial and aerial habitats.
2. Quantify reference health and disease profiles of the animals we tag.
3. Build an online repository to showcase the movement of biodiversity in an urban park that will be
useful to both scientists and the general public.
4. Develop outreach/education efforts in the St Louis region focused on urban biodiversity, including:
a. a joint undergraduate/graduate course in urban wildlife ecology and evolution at WashU,
SLU, NGRREC and Harris Stowe.
b. facilitating student-led outreach with community schools in St. Louis city.

It is important to identify the extent of individual variations in migratory behaviour to better understand species' ability to respond to environmental change. We describe the annual migratory behaviour of British breeding European Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca by using light-recording geolocators. During both autumn and spring migrations, individuals used previously unknown staging areas on the Iberian Peninsula and northern West Africa. Furthermore, partial sex-specific segregation in the location of non-breeding areas was observed within West Africa, with females located west of males. We also found sex-based phenological differences, with females staying longer in non-breeding areas and undertaking the spring Sahara Desert crossing later than males. Irrespective of sex, multiple use of the two predominant staging regions was identified during both migrations, with 63% of individuals stopping more than once in these regions. We also identified instances of migratory behaviours rarely documented in individually tracked songbirds. These include making daytime landfall during the Sahara crossing, and a case of a temporary retreat migration, with an individual aborting a spring Sahara crossing before making a second successful crossing 14 days later. Together, our results show variability in migratory behaviour both between sexes and between individuals. For Pied Flycatchers, such flexible migratory behaviour may increase their resilience to environmental change.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2017-06-03 20:44:16.000,2019-04-17 12:11:44.000,1295,Ficedula hypoleuca,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight",malcburgess (Malcolm Burgess)

However, the energy costs of flying are considerably higher than those of resting. Therefore, when birds fly off after a disturbance, they use extra energy that subsequently needs to be compensated. We measured flight durations of the white-fronted goose, the most common (grass-eating) species wintering in western Europe, by high-frequency accelerometer recordings and made direct observations on these days to determine whether the flight durations were reliably recorded. Using both a simple and a more realistic model of the energy balance, we calculated the extra grass consumption resulting from additional intentional disturbances.
On average, the geese flew daily 2 × 323 s (from and to their roosting sites at 3200 m), and furthermore took to the air 5.3 times during a day (and 1.9 times a night). Multiplied with the average flight durations of 195 s, this gives a total flying time of almost 0.6 h day-1 and a total foraging time of 7.4 h day-1. With an intentional disturbance rate e.g. of five times a day, the birds’ compensation for the increased energy expenditure will lead to a higher overall consumption of grass of 11.5–16 % day-1. Accommodation schemes have to take such increases in total grass consumption into account when deciding on the refuge areas to be set aside.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2015-02-06 00:00:06.000,2015-03-06 23:30:06.000,2914,Anser albifrons,"GPS,Acceleration",andreakoelzsch (Andrea K&ouml;lzsch)

The comments variable for these records has been coded '<i>manually_added_onshore_shuck_location_estimate</i>'. These end locations are weighted averages of all Argos locations collected up to 7-days post-detachment. The Argos Location Class was used for weighting, with LC 3,2,1,0,A,B,Z assigned weights of 100,75,50,15,15,2,1 respectively. Location estimates based on a small sample of low-quality locations were sometimes misrepresentative, in which case the estimates were manually revised to coincide with a nearby coastal site while recognizing well-known frequently-used walrus haulouts. Finally, data for individuals #172 and #174 were actually collected from the same walrus that was instrumented with 2 tags.</br></br>

A wide range of tools has been developed to repel animals from areas where they are suspected to cause damage. For waterfowl, direct comparisons of multiple repelling methods have so far focused only on species´ presence, total numbers, cost effectiveness or subsequent damage assessments, but not on individual behaviour.

Here, we investigated the individual responses of free-flying geese to three repelling methods using high-resolution tracking data. In an experimental setup, tracked individuals were repelled by human approach, gunshot sound or handheld lasers.

We found that repelling success and return time to the field where the repelling took place increased when individuals were repelled multiple times. Travel distances after the repelling events were longer after human approach and gunshot sound compared to the handheld laser treatments. In spring, the probability to return to the same field was higher after repelling with handheld lasers, but no difference between treatments was evident in autumn. We observed no increase in the probability to visit accommodation fields, where geese were allowed to forage and were not repelled, after the repelling events.

Synthesis and applications. We found no strong differences between the three methods regarding the repelling effectiveness and the resulting behaviour of the tracked geese. However, the higher return rates of individuals after repelling with handheld lasers in spring suggest that this method might be less effective in situations with bright sunlight or very large aggregations of geese. Apart from these limitations, we can recommend handheld lasers for repelling as they might reduce energetic losses for the geese and disturbance of non-target wildlife. Since repelling by gunshot sound and handheld lasers was twice as fast as repelling by human approach, those methods will reduce working hours by 50% and therefore be more cost-effective in practice.

Olympia, WA 98501",Matthew.Wilson@dfw.wa.gov,,"Project Description

Management of Taverner’s cackling geese (""Taverner’s"") and lesser Canada Geese (""Lessers"") is confounded by difficulties delineating these subspecies on the breeding grounds due to similar morphological characteristics and undefined breeding ranges. The Pacific Flyway has been unable to finalize a management plan for Lessers and Taverner’s due to the inability to define and monitor these populations. Of particular concern, past marking projects of Lessers staging in interior Alaska and wintering in eastern Washington and Oregon found annual survival rates among the lowest and recovery rates among the highest for comparable populations of marked geese (Eichholz and Sedinger 2007). Delineation of the nesting grounds of these two goose populations, coupled with ongoing genetics research, is critical to the responsible management of Arctic-nesting small Canada geese. 

Project Objectives
1.Utilize satellite platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) to augment efforts to delineate the range of Taverner’s and Lessers.
2.Provide DNA samples to delineate breeding grounds based on genetic differentiation.  
3.Contribute to harvest information knowledge of Taverner’s and Lessers in the Columbia Basin by conducting annual fall and spring banding efforts.  
4.Collect morphological data on captured geese which, in association with genetics information, will enhance morphometric discrimination of Taverner’s and Lessers in the field. 

Key Findings 
•Since spring 2010, we have implanted 21 PTTs in adult female small Canada geese, including 12 spring and 9 fall deployments. We tracked the study subjects to their breeding grounds in northwestern Alaska for the summer (see breeding area map). The birds used breeding and molting sites near Kotzebue Sound, Bering Land Bridge, and the Lisburne Peninsula. They returned to eastern Washington in late October and early November. Most of the geese migrated down the British Columbia coastline, with the exception of one bird which migrated inland through central B.C. Contrary to expectations, none of the study subjects transmitted from known small Canada goose staging areas near Fairbanks, AK. As of September 2013, none of transmitters are active.  The last location was received in July 2013.
•Preliminary DNA analysis from the USGS Alaska Science Center indicates 5 of the 7 study subjects were “small-bodied haplotypes”, or Taverner’s. The other 2 “large-bodied haplotypes” were Lessers. 
•To date, we have received 92 reports of harvested geese from our banded sample. Five banded geese were recovered during the Alaska spring subsistence harvest, including one carrying a PTT.

S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by Microwave Telemetry’s unscheduled development of a satellite/GPS unit small enough to be carried by a Swallow-tailed Kite.
ARCI began tagging Swallow-tailed Kites in 1996 with the smallest satellite transmitters yet produced and soon discovered that the U. S. population’s migration pathway was much different and ended much farther away - over 8,000 kilometers - than had been imagined. By 2005, we had combined this dramatic new remote-sensing technology with direct VHF radio tracking in South America to confirm consistent annual movements over Gulf and Caribbean waters, Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, eastern Central America, and around South America’s Amazon Basin to wintering sites in the heterogeneous landscape of southern Brazil and nearby Bolivia. In 2011, to identify year-round habitat needs and range areas, determine critical breeding areas, estimate annual survival, and investigate migration and wintering threats, we began deploying the smallest ever GPS-equipped satellite transmitters. These devices provide up to eight locations each day, accurate to within 15 meters, for several years.  Such data will enable us to refine management recommendations and intensify conservation efforts where most needed throughout the Swallow-tailed Kites year-round range.

own condition, avoid predators and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS loggers,
features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable conditions can be translated into energetic costs
of movement, which, in turn, can be translated to energy landscapes.We investigated energy landscapes in
Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands.
Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters of dive depth and the proportion of
pelagic and benthic dives varied both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes also
varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to differences in food availability, which were also
reflected in differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic niche metrics. In the second year,
the energy landscape was characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding success was also
higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was
never used.
Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time and that the seabirds forage in areas of the
energy landscapes that result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view of energy landscapes
and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy
landscapes are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging to breeding success.

Competition for the best breeding sites is supposed to be the main driver, but timing of migration is often also influenced by environmental factors such as food availability and wind conditions. Using GPS tags, we tracked 65 greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons migrating between western Europe and the Russian Arctic during spring and autumn migration over six different years. Contrary to theory, our birds took considerably longer for spring migration (83 days) than autumn migration (42 days). This difference in duration was mainly determined by time spent at stopovers. Timing and space use during migration suggest that the birds were using different strategies in the two seasons: In spring they spread out in a wide front to acquire extra energy stores in many successive stopover sites (to fuel capital breeding), which is in accordance with previous results that white-fronted geese follow the green wave of spring growth. In autumn they filled up their stores close to the breeding grounds and waited for supportive wind conditions to quickly move to their wintering grounds. Selection for supportive winds was stronger in autumn, when general wind conditions were less favourable than in spring, leading to similar flight speeds in the two seasons. In combination with less stopover time in autumn this led to faster autumn than spring migration. White-fronted geese thus differ from theory that spring migration is faster than autumn migration. We expect our findings of different decision rules between the two migratory seasons to apply more generally, in particular in large birds in which capital breeding is common, and in birds that meet other environmental conditions along their migration route in autumn than in spring.

Background. The Grevy’s zebra, a grazing ungulate, is endangered and occurs mostly throughout northern Kenya. Major threats include habitat loss, patchy resource distribution and urban area expansion with increasing livestock densities. Given a poor picture of how Grevy’s zebra utilize space on a landscape scale, this study sought to understand their movements based on how key drivers interact with one another to influence their migration and foraging patterns. 
Method. The three movement drivers identified were vegetation and forage resources, human settlements and water availability. Thirty females were monitored using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars between November 2010 and January 2015. The dynamic Brownian Bridge movement model (dBBMM) was applied to analyze space use in separate “wet” and “dry” periods according to rainfall data. A generalized additive model was applied using presence/absence based on Core Foraging areas (CA’s) determined from the dBBMM analysis to test drivers of movement and their interactions. We expected the CAs to be closer to water sources and further from human settlements than expected at random. 
Results. Results indicated that majority of CAs (80%) occur within community managed conservancies. The most significant effects on movement were distance to water and settlements. Grevy’s zebra CAs were a maximum of 15 km from water, and a minimum of 5-8 km from human settlements is predictable, depending on whether it was a rainy or dry season. Results corroborate findings from previous studies that wildlife competition is occurring, especially in areas with high livestock density and inaccessible water sources. 
Conclusion. We provide recommendations for species recovery and resource conservation to ensure the maintenance of core habitat areas, including key linkages traversing areas important to pastoralists and livestock corridors. Our study is the first description of the species connectivity over the central habitat remaining in the core rangelands of Grevy’s zebra.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,1971-05-04 21:00:00.000,2020-08-11 21:00:00.000,24666,"Equidae ","GPS,Radio Transmitter",GZTC (Zeke Davidson)

But the Mesoamerican subspecies A. m. cyanoptera is highly threatened by poaching and habitat loss, largely driven by intentional forest fires, cattle ranching, and the expansion of human settlements. 

For more than two decades, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been leading efforts to save MBR’s scarlet macaw population from extirpation through nest protection programs, monitoring macaw fledging rates at key nesting sites, raising awareness through environmental education involving local communities, and habitat protection initiatives including over flights. As a result, our scarlet macaw conservation strategy is based on a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the entire range of threats and interventions required to conserve the species in Guatemala. 

Currently, we are working to accelerate the pace of recovery of the wild scarlet macaw population through a combination of complementary interventions, including management activities designed to maximize the potential contribution of the natural production of wild scarlet macaws. These include pulling of low weight chicks from their nests to be raised at a field laboratory, placement of laboratory-raised chicks back within foster wild nests when viable, or release of laboratory-raised macaws back into the wild following their preparation within an in – situ flight cage. In addition, we are increasing the availability of nesting cavities by enlarging natural cavities to create potential nests, and preventing and combating Africanized bees’ infestation of nesting cavities. These bees are fervent competitors for nesting cavities and can kill young macaw chicks. Additionally, we have engaged local communities and partners in macaw conservation activities, such as AFISAP community forest concession that harbors important macaws nesting habitat.

The White-crowned Pigeon (WCPi) Patagioenas leucocephala is a Caribbean endemic species, classified as “Near-threatened” (IUCN red list), for which data on the ecology and demography are very sparse, fragmentary and unequal across its distribution area. In particular, very few data are available for the Lesser Antilles despite the fact that the species is much appreciated by local hunters and exposed to habitat loss and fragmentation. As for most colombid species, the species have conserved a strong flight ability and is considered as vagrant, sometimes flying more than 150 km over water to reach another Caribbean island. However, a first study aiming at determining movement pattern of 16 white-crowned pigeons in the Greater Antilles (Florida, Bahamas, Cayman Islands Jamaica and Dominican Republic), using Argos Solar transmitters, have shown that the species was less nomadic than expected. These results seem inconsistent with what it was usually thought and with observations done in the Lesser Antilles, where the species is observable only a part of the year. Therefore, “where do pigeons come from when they arrive in the Lesser-Antilles?” and “where do they go when they leave them?” are the questions we are going to answer by using GPS/Argos transmitters. To this end, white-crowned pigeons from Dominican Republic will be captured and equipped with Solar GPS-Argos tags (PinPoint Argos Solar – S, 6g, Biotrack Inc.), following by pigeons from Antigua and Guadeloupe to reach in total fifteen tracked individuals.  We expect that white-crowned pigeons annually observed in the Lesser Antilles are more nomadic, and they come from bigger colonies located in the Greater Antilles (e.g. Puerto-Rico, Hispaniola or Cuba). This would emphasize a dichotomy in term of strategy of dispersal behaviour, which could depend upon genetic (heritability), behavioural (e.g. personality) and/or ecological (e.g. variation of the carrying capacity of islands) factors, resulting in a certain spatial dynamism at the Caribbean region scale.

The griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is one of the species at higher risk in Spain.  Important densities of griffons are found in the mountain ranges of northern and western Pyrenees and the high Ebro valley.  An aircraft military firing range occupies 2,200 ha in the centre of the Bardena Reales Natural Park. The air exercises involve aircraft flying at different heights on colonies of griffon vulture and broad areas of extensive and intensive livestock farming where vultures and other scavengers feed daily.  As a consequence of this bird strikes have occurred. In view of the problem it is advisable to initiate studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of use of space for griffon vultures in this region. The solutions pass to generate knowledge in order to facilitate decision-making on issues such as the manipulation of habitat quality (food resources in critical areas) and optimizing flight routes and strategies of the aircraft in relation to patterns of displacement of birds. The specific objectives would be therefore to: a) Establish spatio-temporal routines of adult breeding griffon vultures in the region; b) Determine to what extent the management of livestock carcasses conditions such movements; c) Identify the factors favouring the overlap of flying activity of vultures and military aircraft exercises; d) Establish proposals to minimize the risk of collisions between vultures and military aircraft and to optimize the management of livestock carcasses for vulture conservation.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2015-12-21 12:34:53.000,2023-09-10 10:00:26.000,11362434,Gyps fulvus,"GPS,Acceleration",VultureGroup (Manuel de la Riva)

The second site (West Point) is located approximately 35 miles to the west of the 1st site and has no associated mitigation measure for Dall’s sheep. To investigate Dall’s sheep daily movements, home range size, and habitat use in relation to military aircraft activity, GPS radiocollars were placed on sheep captured at each site in March of 1999-2002. Blood sampling and a series of physical measurements took place during capturing, and mortalities were investigated as soon as was reasonable.

To ensure sufficient reproductive output and maintain viable population sizes, migratory animals should match arrival at breeding areas with local peaks in resource availability. It is generally assumed that breeding phenology dictates the timing of the annual cycle, but this is poorly studied. Here, we use light‐level geolocator tracking data to compare the annual spatiotemporal migration patterns of a long‐distance migratory songbird, the red‐backed shrike, Lanius collurio, breeding at widely different latitudes within Europe. We find that populations use remarkably similar migration routes and are highly synchronized in time. Additional tracks from populations breeding at the edges of the European range support these similar migration patterns. When comparing timing of breeding and vegetation phenology, as a measure of resource availability across populations, we find that arrival and timing of breeding corresponds to the peak in vegetation greenness at northern latitudes. At lower latitudes birds arrive simultaneously with the more northerly breeding populations, but after the local greenness peak, suggesting that breeding area phenology does not determine the migratory schedule. Rather, timing of migration in red‐backed shrikes may be constrained by events in other parts of the annual cycle.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-06-24 20:35:00.000,2017-07-07 17:55:00.000,29097,Lanius collurio,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight",lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)

The Red-necked Stint Calidris ruficollis is a small, highly migratory sandpiper along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, which is classified as Near Threatened due to ongoing population declines. We tracked the migration of three Red-necked Stints breeding in southern Chukotka, Russia, using geolocators, and supplemented our tracking data with re-sighting records of color-flagged individuals. The three birds, all of which bred within 2km of each other, wintered in three different localities spanning nearly 5,000km. One individual completed its northward migration of >9400 km in two marathon flights, of which the second leg was completed in a 7-day nonstop flight of 5,350 km.

Distinct stopover and routing behaviour of diurnally and nocturnally migrating songbirds has been stated in the 1960ies but empirical confirmation is yet lacking widely. We studied the behaviour of individual diurnally migrating dunnocks and nocturnally migrating blackcaps by means of large-scale automated radio-telemetry. Birds were radio-tagged during their stopover at the German North Sea coast. Our data indicate longer initial stopover duration in the diurnally migrating dunnocks, opposing the hypothesis of nocturnal migrants needing more time to recover due to their longer migratory flights. Nonetheless, dunnocks stopped over more often along their tracks as when compared to the nocturnally migrating blackcaps. Behaviour en route did not differ as clearly between species challenging the general view of contrasting routings of diurnal and nocturnal migrants with regard to landscape and open water. Our results imply additional factors of relevance other than differences in species or daily migration timing per se.

Es la primera vez que se aborda un proyecto que plantea medidas concretas de conservación en varios núcleos poblacionales, contemplando el conjunto de la metapoblación del mediterráneo noroccidental (España y S de Francia) y ahondando en el estudio de las relaciones entre las diferentes subpoblaciones que lo componen.
El proyecto LIFE BONELLI enfoca la recuperación de la especie en las zonas objetivo, desde una perspectiva global, abarcando acciones de mejora de hábitat, eliminación de factores de riesgo y amenaza, reintroducción y refuerzo poblacional y estudio de las relaciones entre las diferentes subpoblaciones. Todo esto con el apoyo de acciones comunes de gestión, concienciación y diseminación de los resultados del proyecto.
Los animales a reintroducir se obtendrán gracias a la cría en cautividad de águila de Bonelli en centros de cría especializados (GREFA y LPO), mediante la recuperación de aves heridas en CRFS y con el rescate y desnide de pollos de las poblaciones donantes de Andalucía.
El beneficiario coordinador del proyecto LIFE BONELLI es Gestión Ambiental de Navarra (dependiente del Gobierno de Navarra) y los beneficiarios asociados son la Junta de Andalucía, Comunidad de Madrid, Consorci per la recuperación de la Fauna de les Illes Balears (dependiente del Govern Balear), Diputación Foral de Álava-Arabako Foru Aldundia, Grupo de Rehabilitación de la Fauna Autóctona y su Hábitat y la Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux.

Tiene un presupuesto de 2.062.691 €, con una contribución europea de 1.545.252 € entre los años 2013 - 2017.

Little is known about the natural history and ecology of the striped mud turtle (Kinosternon baurii), although previous work in Florida suggest that these aquatic turtles are highly terrestrial and nest primarily in the fall. We are currently conducting a population and spatial ecology project on the striped mud turtle using radio telemetry at Circle B Bar Reserve, a restored former cattle ranch adjacent to Lake Hancock, Polk County, Florida. To date, we are tracking six striped mud turtles, and we are collecting standard natural history data on morphology and reproduction. In addition, we have implemented a continuous mark and recapture study for this population. Our data indicate that these mud turtles have a fairly small home range (no single movement more than 75m) with males generally moving more often and greater distances than females. The health of captured turtles is generally good, although feral pigs and human interactions (especially after national news events) appear to represent the greatest threats to the turtles. The population at Circle B does not appear to be dense, as we recapture many of the same turtles. However, after almost 2 years of sampling, we are still capturing unmarked turtles and the population is represented by multiple size classes from small juveniles to large females. Overall, the data we have collected is helping Circle B Bar Reserve understand more about their striped mud turtle population and expands their knowledge of the wildlife they protect. With specific knowledge on the population size and habitat use, Circle B and other reserves/parks in central Florida can better accommodate small, often overlooked aquatic turtles into their management plans.

Snail Kites feed almost entirely on a single species, the Apple Snail (Pomacea paludosa), which is influenced by the timing and distribution of surface water conditions.  Striking declines in Snail Kites have been directly tied to human-caused changes in hydrology. The species is listed as Endangered federally and by the state of Florida. Our first satellite-tracking study (2007-2009) determined the differences in cost and effectiveness between satellite and VHF radio telemetry for locating marked Snail Kites following dispersal, for describing habitat use and home ranges, and for estimating survivorship.  Survival over two years for this small sample (n=10) was 100% based on satellite telemetry, but VHF tracking of the same sample of birds (i.e., each individual carried a satellite and a VHF transmitter) estimated less than 50% survival over the same two-year period. Satellite tracking also produced significantly larger home-range estimates than VHF tracking and revealed short-term/long-distance movements to outlying activity centers that may represent refugia or other vital destinations during declining conditions.  In 2012, we deployed satellite transmitters on 12 additional adult Snail Kites to study movements and habitat selection in relation to snail abundance (with UWF biologists), natural versus altered wetlands, toxins (copper and mercury), and proposed wind-farm developments. For this project, the satellite transmitters include GPS receivers capable of 10-15 meter accuracy.  Such finely-scaled location data will inform critical management decisions for Snail Kites and the greater Everglades ecosystem.

The population has been monitored since 1998 so that 90% of the birds are now individualized by means of plastic rings. The Canarian Egyptian vulture population is increasing about 5% per year but still supports relatively high rates of unnatural deaths, mainly caused by accidents on power lines, although the impact of toxic compounds as lead from ammunition and veterinary drugs plays also a relevant role. This study uses GPS/GSM radio transmitters to determine the use of space both by territorial individuals and birds in the pre-adult stage.

This process has led to an increase in both the population size and the extent of its range. Thus again they become a key role in the functioning of ecosystems being also an important socioeconomic resource. Andalusia hosts important populations of native and introduced wild ungulates and game management is a dynamic element of rural economies and a source of food resources for communities of vertebrate scavengers many of which are endangered species. In fact, the binomial ungulates-scavengers provide an important ecosystem service that has hardly been studied. This project aims to address the interactions between conservation biology and game management. With this overall objective is intended to analyze the factors that determine the structure and functioning of food webs associated scavengers to the big game, the movement patterns of resource consumers that have different spatial and temporal predictability, the capacity of the system to maintain viable populations of carrion birds and, finally, to evaluate some of the emerging risks associated with consumption of carcasses of large game such as lead poisoning.

operating area (OPAREA) waters off the Virginia coast are heavily utilized for training and testing by the
U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. Over the past three years, HDR has worked with the U.S. Navy to
carry out vessel-based line transect visual surveys, photo-identification (photo ID) surveys, and focal
follow surveys with the goal of determining bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) densities and site
fidelity as well as humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) habitat use within waters adjacent to naval
Station Norfolk, Joint Expiditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck
Annex, and within and the MINEX W-50. 

To establish baseline occurrence and behavior data for humpback whales in the Hampton Roads mid-Atlantic region, this study aims to address the following questions:
• What age classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) are utilizing the waters within and adjacent to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay?
• Do humpback whales exhibit site-fidelity over periods of days to years?
• Do humpback whales congregate in specific high-traffic and/or high-use U.S. Navy training areas?
• Do humpback whales spend significant time within or move through areas of U.S. Navy live-fire and MINEX training?

However, relatively little information exists on how numerous offshore species, including beaked whales and endangered fin and sperm whales utilize the waters of the VACAPES OPAREA near the continental shelf break habitat.
Recent aerial surveys by the Virginia Aquarium, University of North Carolina Wilmington, and HDR (HDR,
2010), as well as vessel surveys by HDR, suggest that baleen whales, sperm whales, and other deep
diving odontocetes may be more common to the area of interest than first thought. The objectives of this
study are to utilize a combination of techniques including 1) photo-ID and behavioral data collection to
provide baseline assessments of animal movement patterns, site-fidelity, habitat use, life-history, and
behavior; 2) biopsy sampling to identify individuals, determine foraging patterns, and assist in delineating
stock structure boundaries; 3) satellite-monitored tagging techniques to supplement photo-ID-based
studies by providing information on residency patterns and habitat use across longer time scales (weeks
to months).

Such differences can drive variation in survival and
reproduction. Knowledge of where, when, and why individuals move is therefore crucial to understanding and predicting population-level processes, particularly in the context of oceanographic
change. Here we present the first year-round tracking data for Cassin’s auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, a small, zooplanktivorous North Pacific seabird, revealing the nonbreeding behavior of birds from colonies in British Columbia, Canada, across 3 years of variable oceanographic conditions. These birds moved both north (summer, fall) and south (fall, winter) from the colony, using
1 of 4 migratory tactics: North, South, North-South, or Local. Distributions ranged from the Aleutian Islands to Baja California, to maximum distances of 2757 and 3110 km, respectively. Within
tactics there was additional spatiotemporal variation among individuals, resulting in diverse nonbreeding experiences. Some variability was explained by year and sex. Cassin’s auklets appear to
target distinct, ecologically differentiated areas within their nonbreeding range which may have
good quality habitat. Variation in these target regions across years suggests somewhat flexible
migratory behavior; however, consistent migration to the Southern California Bight despite very
low productivity in one study year suggests that fixed tactics may exist. This work contributes to
our understanding of predator movement in the North Pacific and highlights the importance of
individual-level spatial data for studies of carryover effects and conservation planning.

However, due to difficulties in following individual birds on migration, we still lack knowledge about the spatiotemporal origin of protandry during the annual cycle, impeding our understanding of the proximate drivers of this phenomenon. Here, we use full annual cycle tracking data of red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio to investigate the occurrence of sex-related differences in migratory pattern, which could be viewed as precursors (proximate causes) to protandry. We find protandry with males arriving an estimated 8.3 days (SE = 4.1) earlier at the breeding area than females. Furthermore, we find that, averaged across all departure and arrival events throughout the annual cycle, males migrate an estimated 5.3 days earlier than females during spring compared to 0.01 days in autumn. Event-wise estimates suggest that a divergence between male and female migratory schedules is initiated at departure from the main non-breeding area, thousands of kilometres from, and several months prior to arrival at the breeding area. Duration of migration, flight speed during migration and spatial locations of stationary sites were similar between sexes. Our results reveal that protandry might arise from sex-differential migratory schedules emerging at the departure from the main non-breeding area in southern Africa and retained throughout spring migration, supporting the view that sex-differential selection pressure operates during spring migration rather than autumn migration.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-06-24 20:35:00.000,2016-02-29 17:21:00.000,18511,Lanius collurio,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight",lypedersen (Lykke Pedersen)

Even for the best-studied dispersal system of the Neotropics, Virola nobilis, the dispersal kernel remains unknown. We combined high-resolution GPS/3D-acceleration bird tracking, seed retention experiments, and field observations to quantify dispersal of V. nobilis by their principal dispersers, Ramphastos toucans. We inferred feeding events from movement data, and then estimated spatio-temporally explicit seed-dispersal kernels. Toucans moved an average of 1.8 km d-1 with two distinct activity peaks. Seed retention time averaged 25.5 min (range 4-98 min). Estimated seed dispersal distance averaged 144±147m, with a 56% likelihood of dispersal >100m; this is 2X further than the behaviour-naive estimate from the same data. Dispersal was furthest for seeds ingested in the morning (morning mean 152±154m, midday mean 95±83m), and increased with seed retention time, but only up to 60 min after feeding. Our study supports the long-standing hypothesis that toucans are excellent dispersers of Virola seeds. To maximize seed dispersal distances trees should ripen fruit in the morning when birds move the most, and produce fruits with gut-processing times around 60 min. We also demonstrate how new tracking technology can yield nuanced seed dispersal kernels for animals that cannot be directly observed.",research,true,true,false,true,False,na,2007-12-08 21:31:31.998,2007-12-16 15:15:24.000,2480,"Pteroglossus torquatus,Ramphastos sulfuratus,Ramphastos swainsonii","GPS,Acceleration",Rolandisimo (Roland Kays)

Landfills all over the world attract birds, which use them as a food source. When these landfills are located in close proximity to airports, the birds constitute serious hazards to aircrafts and their crew. In Israel, among the most prevalent species visiting landfills is the Black Kite (Milvus migrans). 
The Black Kite is a medium-sized raptor that migrates through Israel during the spring and autumn, and winters in large numbers throughout the country. Its population in Israel has increased from few thousands during the 1990’s years to present numbers of more than 30,000, only in the Northern Negev. The Ganei-Hadas and Dudaim waste Facilities, located 10 kilometers from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Hatzerim airbase, attract the highest number of Black Kites. Besides these two landfills, the Black Kites also feed in open fields and inside the airbase. 
The landfills’ proximity to the airbase causes constant conflicts, during the over-wintering period, between the Black Kites and the IAF aircrafts. The presence of the kites within Hatzerim airspace leads to direct collisions with aircrafts, impedes important training flights and negatively impacts the base operational competence. Therefore, there is an immediate need to understand movement patterns of these wintering kites.
My research goals are: 
1. Track and monitor movement patterns and behavior of the Black Kites in the Northern Negev; 
2. Examine the influence of food availability, using manipulation experiments at the landfill, on Black Kites movement, habitat selection, spatial distribution and behavior; 
3. Incorporate information on Black Kite movement patterns with remote sensing methods to mitigate Black Kite and aircraft collisions at Hatzerim airbase, as well as other airbases. 
This study is planned to be the first to assess the movement ecology of an abundant over-wintering raptor and the factors influencing it in Israel. The goals will be achieved by monitoring individuals using GPS and acceleration tags, and monitoring Black Kite populations using field surveys, cameras and a Multi-Mission Hemispheric Radar.

The acoustic lek mating behavior of the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) in the Congo basin was first described in the 1970s. More recently molecular testing implicated this species and other African bats as potential reservoir hosts for Ebola virus and it was one of only two fruit bat species epidemiologically linked to the 2008 Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola outbreak. Here we share findings from the first pilot study of hammer-headed bat movement using GPS tracking and accelerometry units and a small preceding radio-tracking trial at an apparent lekking site. The radio-tracking revealed adult males had high rates of nightly visitation to the site compared to females (only one visit) and that two of six females day-roosted ~100 m west of Libonga, the nearest village that is ~1.6 km southwest. Four months later, in mid-April 2018, five individual bats, comprised of four males and one female, were tracked from two to 306 days, collecting from 67 to 1022 GPS locations. As measured by mean distance to the site and proportion of nightly GPS locations within 1 km of the site (percent visitation), the males were much more closely associated with the site (mean distance 1.4 km; 51% visitation), than the female (mean 5.5 km; 2.2% visitation). Despite the small sample size, our tracking evidence supports our original characterization of the site as a lek, and the lek itself is much more central to male than female movement.

As a consequence a large number of the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate in the cave and spoil. Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3(rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting quietly in trees in the rainforest where they regurgitate seeds. This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis.

Juveniles used flapping flight versus soaring flight 23% more than adults and were estimated to expend 14% more energy during flight. Juveniles did not compensate for increased flight costs by increased refueling or resting during migration. When juveniles and adults migrated together in the same flock, the juvenile flew mostly behind the adult and was left behind when they separated.

Differences in size and environmental characteristics of ontogenetic habitats can lead to differences in movement patterns, behaviour, habitat use and spatial distributions across individuals of the same species. Knowledge of juvenile loggerhead turtles’ dispersal, movements and habitat use is largely unknown, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Satellite relay data loggers were used to monitor movements, diving behaviour and water temperature of eleven large juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) deliberately caught in an oceanic habitat in the Mediterranean Sea. Hidden Markov Models were used over 4430 spatial locations to quantify the different activities performed by each individual: transit, low and high intensity diving. Model results were then analysed in relation to water temperature, bathymetry and distance to the coast. The Hidden Markov Model differentiated between bouts of Area Restricted Search as low and high intensity diving, and transit movements. The turtles foraged in deep oceanic waters within 60 km from the coast as well as above 140 km from the coast. They used an average area of 194802 km2, where most individuals used the deepest part of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea with the highest seamounts, while only two switched to neritic foraging showing plasticity in foraging strategies among turtles of similar age classes. The foraging distribution of large juvenile loggerhead turtles, including some which were of the minimum size of adults, in the Tyrrhenian Sea is mainly concentrated in a relatively small oceanic area with predictable mesoscale oceanographic features, despite the proximity of suitable neritic foraging habitats.

Here we use micro radio telemetry to show that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large areas (at least 42 – 115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from core ranges. When following individual bees we found them to be stationary for variable lengths of time and then fly to a new site where again they remained stationary. In addition our data suggest a bimodal frequency distribution of home range sizes. We propose individuals either use multiple widely-separated core areas or have a central core with an extremely large periphery where they gather resources.

We investigated the effects of sensory manipulation on oceanic navigation in Scopoli’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) breeding at Pianosa island (Italy), by displacing them 400 km from their colony and tracking them. A recent experiment on Atlantic shearwaters (Cory’s shearwater, Calonectris borealis) breeding in the Azores indicated a crucial role of olfaction over the open ocean, but left open the question of whether birds might navigate by topographical landmark cues when available. Our experiment was conducted in the Mediterranean sea, where the availability of topographical cues may provide an alternative navigational mechanism for homing. Magnetically disturbed shearwaters and control birds oriented homeward even when the coast was not visible and rapidly homed.

We differentiated seven classes of land cover—alfalfa, annually rotated irrigated crops, developed, grassland, orchard / vineyard, rice, and water. From 2011–2013, we fitted transmitters with global positioning systems to 23 adult Swainson’s Hawks. We recorded a minimum of six locations per day per bird from spring through early autumn of each year. We used a fixed, bivariate-normal kernel estimator to calculate a utilization distribution at 30-m resolution for each life stage of each individual within each year. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the associations between intensity of space use and land cover, sex, and reproductive status. The majority of adult Swainson’s Hawks traveled distances up to 8–10 km from the nest throughout the breeding season. Median seasonal home-range sizes in a given year ranged from 87–172 km2. The association between intensity of space use and grassland was 50–139% stronger, and the association between intensity of space use and alfalfa 23–59% stronger, than the associations between intensity of space use and any other land-cover type. Intensity of space use did not vary as a function of sex, reproductive status, or life stage. Given our results and additional knowledge of the species’ ecology, we suggest that reproductive success and, in turn, population-level recruitment may be associated equally if not more closely with availability of nesting sites than with the current distribution of land cover.

In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.

Studies of flight and its impact on the movement ecology of birds must consider the wind to help us understand aerodynamics and bird flight strategies. Here, we introduce a systematic approach to evaluate wind speed and direction from the high-frequency GPS recordings from bird-borne tags during thermalling flight. Our method assumes that a fixed horizontal mean wind speed during a short (18 seconds, 19 GPS fixes) flight segment with a constant turn angle along a closed loop, characteristic of thermalling flight, will generate a fixed drift for each consequent location. We use a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate that drift and to determine the wind and airspeeds at the birds' flight locations. We also provide error estimates for these GPS-derived wind speed estimates. We validate our approach by comparing its wind estimates with the mid-resolution weather reanalysis data from ECMWF, and by examining independent wind estimates from pairs of birds in a large dataset of GPS-tagged migrating storks that were flying in close proximity. Our approach provides accurate and unbiased observations of wind speed and additional detailed information on vertical winds and uplift structure. These precise measurements are otherwise rare and hard to obtain and will broaden our understanding of atmospheric conditions, flight aerodynamics, and bird flight strategies.

The spatial structure and dynamic properties of animal migrations and population flyways largely determine those trophic and transport effects, but are yet poorly studied. As a basis, we propose a periodic Markov model on the spatial migration network of breeding, stopover and wintering sites to formally describe the process of animal migration on the population level. From seasonally changing transition rates we derived stable, seasonal densities of animals at the network nodes. We parametrized the model with high-quality GPS and satellite telemetry tracks of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons). Topological and network flow properties of the two derived networks conform to migration properties like seasonally changing connectivity and shared, directed movement. Thus, the model realistically describes the migration movement of complete populations and can become an important tool to study the effects of climate and habitat change and pathogen spread on migratory animals. Furthermore, the property of periodically changing transition rates makes it a new type of complex model and we need to understand its dynamic properties.

Adults, males and higher quality individuals typically arrive earlier, and across years, early arrival has been linked to warmer spring temperatures. However, the mechanisms and potential costs of early arrival are not well understood. 
(2) To deepen the understanding of arrival date differences between individuals and years, we studied them in light of the preceding spring migration behaviour and atmospheric conditions en route. 
(3) GPS and body‐acceleration (ACC) data were obtained for 35 adult white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over five years (2012‐2016). ACC records were translated to energy expenditure estimates (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration; ODBA) and to behavioural modes, and GPS fixes were coupled with environmental parameters. 
(4) At the inter‐individual level (within years), early arrival was attributed primarily to departing earlier for migration and from more northern wintering sites (closer to breeding grounds), rather than to migration speed. In fact, early departing birds flew slower, experienced weaker thermal uplifts and expended more energy during flight, but still arrived earlier, emphasizing the cost and the significance of early departure. Individuals that wintered further south arrived later at the breeding grounds but did not produce fewer fledglings, presumably due to positive carry‐over effects of advantageous wintering conditions (increased precipitation, vegetation productivity and daylight time). Therefore, early arrival increased breeding success only after controlling for wintering latitude. Males arrived slightly ahead of females. Between years, late arrival was linked to colder temperatures en route through two different mechanisms: stronger headwinds causing slower migration and lower thermal uplifts resulting in longer stopovers. 
(5) This study showed that distinct migratory properties underlie arrival time variation within and between years. It highlighted: (a) an overlooked cost of early arrival induced by unfavourable atmospheric conditions during migration, (b) an important fitness trade‐off in storks between arrival date and wintering habitat quality, and (c) mechanistic explanations for the negative temperature‐arrival date correlation in soaring birds. Such understanding of arrival time can facilitate forecasting migrating species responses to climate changes.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2012-01-22 02:00:44.000,2016-06-04 20:00:10.000,1207130,Ciconia ciconia,"GPS,Acceleration,Accessory Measurements",shay.rotics

However, the actual migratory path and whales’ behaviour in these locations are poorly known. The objectives of this study were to apply a switching state-space model to the satellite tracks of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Northeast Pacific to improve location estimation and gain insight into the migratory (transiting) and foraging (area-restricted search, ARS) behaviours of this population. During the period 1993 to 2007, Argos satellite tags were attached to 159 whales, mainly off the coast of California during late summer, of which 92 tracks were >7 d in duration. There was generally a southward movement during the winter to Baja California and to an area west of the Costa Rica Dome, in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). Travel speeds during transit were significantly faster than during ARS movements (mean = 3.70 and 1.05 km h^–1, respectively). On average, 29% of the track time was spent in ARS, and the mean time within an ARS patch was 21 d. The occurrence of ARS behaviour throughout the migration cycle suggests that these animals may forage year-round, but could also indicate limited movements during the reproductive season.

We present satellite tracking data on common cuckoos experimentally displaced 1,800 km eastward from Rybachy to Kazan. After displacement, both young and adult travelled similarly towards the route of non-displaced control birds. The tracking data demonstrate the potential for young common cuckoos to return to the species-specific migration route after displacement, a response so far reported exclusively in experienced birds.

After solar-powered transmitters became available in 1995, extended battery life combined with the possibility to replace transmitters over time allowed monitoring the movements of individual storks across multiple migration seasons, with one individual, Prinzesschen, tracked for over a decade. Research efforts continue using primarily GSM-based tracking technologies. This dataset includes over 200 storks tagged in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Israel, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain and Switzerland. As noted in the deployment information, some movements are influenced by experimental manipulations. This long-term study confirms what previous several-year tracking studies of white storks had indicated: there can be great variability from year to year in the choice of winter quarters as well as in the routes and times of migration, intermediate destinations and stop-over periods, but constancy of winter quarters and migration routes is also possible. The variability may well be caused by external factors, of which food supply is probably predominant.<br><br>

Ancient Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus), small marine diving birds of which half of the world’s population breeds in BC, are especially susceptible to oiling immediately after departing from their breeding colonies, as their offspring are flightless, constraining their parents to remain with them. In2014 we deployed geolocator loggers on Ancient Murrelets at four breeding colonies, two on the east and two on the west coast of Haida Gwaii to investigate patterns of post-breeding dispersal and subsequent migratory movements. Birds from east coast colonies moved south and east after leaving their colonies, remaining in Queen Charlotte Sound and adjacent waters for 4–6 weeks, whereas those from west coast colonies moved steadily north and west, so that they left BC waters earlier than those from east coast colonies. These movements were consistent with being driven by surface currents. In June, all birds moved rapidly to the eastern Aleutians, SE Bering Sea, and waters off Kamchatka, where they probably moulted. In August, most moved north, some passing through Bering Straits into the Chukchi Sea. In October-November some birds returned to waters off western North America (33%) and the remainder carried on westwards to waters off Japan, Korea and NE China. For the former group the movement to the Bering Sea in June constituted a moult migration and, as such, is the first described for an auk. Those birds wintering in Asia began moving east in February and arrived off BC in March, when observations at colonies show that burrow visits begin in Haida Gwaii. Our data suggest that, immediately after colony departure, birds from the east coast colonies (about half the population of Haida Gwaii) are at higher risk from potential oil spills in northern British Columbia waters than those breeding on the west coast.

Behav.: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds’ incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage. PLoS One: Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/ 0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study. Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein, triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1–3 days) showed limited impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey. Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2010-11-14 22:00:37.000,2011-01-23 22:31:54.000,61523,Eudyptes chrysocome,GPS,masello (Masello)

The main objectives are to reconnect remaining natural forest fragments and to reforest the margins of rivers and their head-waters, in order to increase and improve water production, and to protect the biodiversity in one of the most industrialized and urbanized areas in the state.  The production of quality water, on the other hand, will foster the increase and improvement of the forested area, as well as the conditions for a more efficient and sustainable management of the soil for agricultural purposes. 
The puma (Puma concolor) is a flagship species for the development of the ecological corridor. Its presence was confirmed during the first field surveys conducted in the project, and it confirms the adaptation of this large predator to an environment that few would classify as favorable. The area consists of small fragments of remaining natural forest immersed in a matrix of sugarcane plantations and pastures, in a highly industrialized and urbanized landscape.  One of the important aspects of the puma, as a top predator, is its capacity to control prey species included in its diet. Thus, it helps prevent any undue population increases of those species, even though some are being favored by the modified human environment.

Plasticity in movement strategies allows a species to better track spatial dynamics of habitat quality. We describe the mechanisms that shape the movement of a long-distance migrant bird (turkey vulture, Cathartes aura) across two continents using satellite tracking coupled with remote-sensing science. Using nearly 10 years of data from 24 satellite-tracked vultures in four distinct populations, we describe an enormous amount of variation in their movement patterns. We related vulture movement to environmental conditions and found important correlations explaining how far they need to move to find food (indexed by the normalized difference vegetation index) and how fast they can move based on the prevalence of thermals and temperature. We conclude that the extensive variability in the movement ecology of turkey vultures, facilitated by their energetically efficient thermal soaring, suggests that this species is likely to do well across periods of modest climate change. The large scale and sample sizes needed for such analysis in a widespread migrant emphasizes the need for integrated and collaborative efforts to obtain tracking data and for policies, tools and open datasets to encourage such collaborations and data sharing.",research,true,true,false,true,False,na,2003-11-14 16:00:00.000,2013-03-19 03:00:00.000,215719,Cathartes aura,GPS,dbarber (David Barber)

Specifically, the program has been longitudinally monitoring the ecology, behavior, health and reproduction of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) living in low versus high human activity areas. We also have been evaluating the impact of domestic animals, especially dogs on the health of the carnivore community, in particular maned wolves. The research has been conducted with the different approaches, however data from radiotelemetry has been the starting point for all the crossed analysis. 
Since 2004, 73 animals have been collared. Until 2009 the option of using conventional telemetry restrained us to certain information collected. Since 2007 we have been using GPS-based telemetry in order to obtain more specific information. The data collected from the 13 GPS-collared animals in the last 8 years have been essential for management practices in the project’s site and has been influenced public policies and even the species status in the Brazilian Red List.

Tail-mounted GPS-fitted birds showed significantly higher cumulative numbers of flap-glide cycles and a higher pitch angle of the tail than accelerometer-equipped birds, indicating problems with balancing inappropriately placed weights with knock-on consequences relating to energy expenditure.

Remote habitat and cryptic nature make the leopards inherently difficult to study while sufficient information is crucial on which to base effective conservation. Here, we report preliminary findings from the first comprehensive telemetry study on Persian leopard P. p. saxicolor in northeastern Iran, near the Turkmenistan border. Between September 2014 and August 2016, we captured six adult leopards (5 males and 1 female) and fitted them with GPS-satellite Iridium collars to provide information on basic ecology of the Persian leopard. We calculated MCP 100% home ranges of 62.9 to 1,098.3 km2. The ranges here were generally smaller than the one of the only other Persian leopard collared before this study in an arid mountain area in central Iran, except for the young, possibly dispersing male that we collared. Two leopards crossed international borders and wandered into Turkmenistan, revealing that two countries may share connected leopard population across the Kopet Dag region.

V4K 3N2",laurie.wilson@canada.ca,,"Increased shipping in British Columbia waters poses risks for marine birds. Ancient
Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus), of which half of the world's population breeds
in Haida Gwaii, BC, are especially susceptible to oiling during the period immediately
after departing from their breeding colonies, as their offspring are flightless for more
than a month, constraining their parents to remain with them. In 2014 we deployed
geolocator loggers on breeding Ancient Murrelets at four colonies, two on the east and
two on the west coast of Haida Gwaii to investigate patterns of post-breeding dispersal
and subsequent migratory movements. Birds from east coast colonies moved south
and east after leaving their colonies, remaining in Queen Charlotte Sound and adjacent
waters for 4-6 weeks. Those from the west coast colonies moved north and west and
mostly continued in the same direction, so that they left BC waters earlier than those
from east coast colonies. This initial period of slow movement, presumably while chicks
were flightless, was consistent with being driven by surface currents. In June, with
brood-rearing apparently completed, all birds moved rapidly to the eastern Aleutians
and SE Bering Sea, some continuing to waters off Kamchatka. Moult probably started
soon after this rapid migration phase. In August most birds moved north, some passing
through Bering Straits where observations at sea show they are in basic plumage. In
October-November the sample split into two groups, one returning to waters off
western N America (33%) and the remainder carrying on westwards to waters off
Japan, Korea and NE China. For the former group the movement to the Bering Sea in
June constitutes a moult migration and, as such, is the first described for an auk. The
Asian-wintering birds started moving eastwards in February and arrived off BC in the
second half of March, when observations at colonies show that burrow visits begin in
Haida Gwaii. Our data suggest that during their most vulnerable phase, immediately
after colony departure, birds from the east coast colonies (about half the population of
Haida Gwaii) are at higher risk than those breeding on the west coast from potential oil
spills in northern British Columbia waters.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,,hashimotoy (Yuriko)

Williamsburg, VA 23187",fmsmit@wm.edu,,"The whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) is a large, highly migratory shorebird that breeds in arctic and sub-arctic latitudes and winters in the tropics. The North American race (N.p. hudsonicus) includes three disjunct breeding populations, all of which winter primarily in Central and South America. The two rufiventris populations breed in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada (Engelmoer and Roselaar 1998). These western whimbrels primarily use different migration routes and wintering grounds and are most likely genetically segregated populations (CCB/CWS unpublished tracking data). The hudsonicus population breeds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands along the James and Hudson Bays (Jehl and Smith 1970, Skeel and Mallory 1996). The populations of whimbrels utilizing the Atlantic Coast and northeast South America have declined by up to 50% in recent decades (Watts and Truitt 2011, and RIG Morrison et al., unpublished data, from Andres et al. 2012) and both the hudsonicus and Northwest Territories rufiventris populations are of conservation concern (Morrison 2006, Bart et al. 2007, Watts and Truitt 2011).
In an effort to better understand the population size and habitat use of whimbrels utilizing the Acadian peninsula during fall migration, we designed aerial and ground based surveys to accomplish this goal. We detected 339 whimbrels during the first aerial survey and 615 during the second survey. Whimbrels were distributed along the peninsula from Brantville to Miscou Island, though concentrations of whimbrels were higher near Miscou Island. Of the 954 whimbrels detected on aerial surveys, 908 (95%) were observed in harvest stage fields, 5 (<1%) in development stage fields, 7 (<1%) flushed from unknown stage fields, and 34 (3.5%) from coastal beaches or barrier islands. We surveyed 103 ground transects twice each during the field season. We surveyed a total length of 58.5 km of transects within the five geographic areas (Brantville, Lord and Foy, Val-Doucet, Tracadie-Sheila, and Pigeon Hill/Lameque Island). We surveyed approximately 1,448 hectares of blueberry fields, with 773ha in active blueberry production, 653ha in growth stage, and 32ha in development. A total of 690 whimbrels were detected in the two survey rounds, with majority of detections in harvest stage fields (N=637, 92%), and 53 detections (8%) in either growth or development stage. A total of 565 (82%) whimbrels detected during survey round 1, and 125 (18%) during survey round 2.
The Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick, Canada appears to support a significant portion of the total whimbrel population that uses Atlantic Canada in fall migration. Over 99% of all whimbrels detected during the aerial, ground, and evening roost surveys originated from blueberry fields, suggesting that tidal influences on behavior are negligible. Warden pressure on the whimbrels in the blueberry fields is quite high and needs to be addressed.

These movements are relatively well understood at a population level, but how individual insects achieve them remains elusive. Behavioral responses to conditions en route are little studied, primarily owing to the challenges of tracking individual insects. Using a light aircraft and individual radio tracking, we show that nocturnally migrating death’s-head hawkmoths maintain control of their flight trajectories over long distances. The moths did not just fly with favorable tailwinds; during a given night, they also adjusted for head and crosswinds to precisely hold course. This behavior indicates that the moths use a sophisticated internal compass to maintain seasonally beneficial migratory trajectories independent of wind conditions, illuminating how insects traverse long distances to take advantage of seasonal resources.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2018-09-10 18:30:00.000,2019-10-14 16:12:36.000,274,"Acherontiini ",Radio Transmitter,martin (Martin Wikelski)

Yet, high mobility may allow aerial insectivores to adjust their foraging strategy to different prey distri- butions. We investigated whether aerial-hunting common noctules Nyctalus noctula adjust their foraging strategy to landscapes with different habitat complexity and assumingly different prey distribution. We hypothesized that the movement behaviour of hunting common noctules and changes of movement behaviour in reaction towards conspecifics would depend on whether they hunt in a structurally poor cropland dom- inated landscape or a structurally rich forest dominated landscape. We tracked flight paths of common noctules in northeastern Germany using GPS loggers equipped with an ultrasonic microphone that recorded foraging events and presence of conspecifics. Above cropland, common noctules hunted mainly during bouts of highly tortuous and area restricted movements (ARM). Bats switched from straight flight to ARM after encountering conspecifics. In the forested landscape, common noctules hunted both during ARM and during straight flights. The onset of ARM did not correlate with the presence of conspecifics. Common noctules showed a lower feeding rate and encountered more conspecifics above the forested than above the cropland dominated landscape. We conjecture that prey distribution above cropland was patchy and unpre- dictable, thus making eavesdropping on hunting conspecifics crucial for bats during search for prey patches. In contrast, small scale structural diversity of the forested landscape possibly led to a more homogeneous prey distribution at the landscape scale, thus enabling bats to find sufficient food independent of conspecific presence. This suggests that predators depending on ephemeral prey can increase their foraging suc- cess in structurally poor landscapes by using social information provided by conspecif- ics. Hence, a minimum population density might be obligatory to enable successful foraging in simplyfied landscapes.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2016-07-22 19:52:31.000,2018-07-21 23:04:52.000,5627,Nyctalus noctula,GPS,manuelroeleke (Manuel Roeleke)

The successful management and control of introduced mammalian predators is dependent on some knowledge of space use and movements in order to target a population and monitor outcomes. In Australia, these tasks are made complex as there is more than one significant introduced mammalian predator, namely the European red fox Vulpes vulpes and feral cat Felis catus, the landscapes are vast, and individual-level interactions between predators are little studied. The impact of these two introduced predators is large and a significant factor in the extinction of many of the country’s small- to medium-sized mammals, either regionally or globally. In a three-year study, we used high-frequency location data, the deployment of the latest GPS tracking technologies, and recent advances in statistical modeling to examine how these two species distributed themselves in space, the degree to which individual distributions overlapped, intra- and interspecific interactions, and temporal patterns of activity in an arid landscape. In the absence of an apex predator, the two introduced mesopredators showed large differences in how they distribute themselves across the landscape and interact with conspecifics. The red fox mostly occupies defined territories, while most feral cats roam apparently independent of each other with occasional periods of frequent interaction with conspecifics of either sex. Intraspecific attraction was strongest in cats, while interspecific avoidance was observed in both directions. The home ranges of feral cats that were range-resident were 3–3.5 times larger than foxes in the same landscape. Notably, we observed long-distance movements in feral cats and some were displaced up to 164 km from their point of release. A greater portion of the feral cat population were non-sedentary and therefore likely less amenable to local control efforts than foxes. Given the different patterns of distribution in time and space, the reliable monitoring of population trends or estimates of abundance will necessarily differ in extent, intensity, or duration for the same level of precision and/or require a different method for monitoring each population.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2016-07-31 17:41:05.000,2018-12-04 15:20:00.000,112345,Felis catus,GPS,droshier (David Roshier)

One method of removing predators is to relocate “problem raptors” away from the Base, a process also known as translocation. The Base and others have used translocation without fully assessing the efficacy of this method since it has relied on the identification of returning individuals with previously attached, unique, leg colorbands. This study quantified return rates and survival of raptors fitted with satellite transmitters and translocated distances greater than those recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Success was measured by survival of the translocated raptors for at least 60 days following release, and whether they returned to the least tern and plover nesting colonies during the breeding season. Over three breeding seasons we translocated 20 raptors of five different species fitted with transmitters; all birds were moved a minimum of 240 miles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were moved at least 500 miles. Most (80%) of the translocated birds survived 60 days or longer following translocation. Northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) were the most frequently documented and translocated “problem raptor,” including one nesting male that was captured and translocated in two different years. Birds returned to MCBCP 12 times; only one, an adult northern harrier, returned prior to 15 Aug. Juvenile red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicencis) generally moved along their expected migration path north to the Great Basin before returning south to the Base. Eleven birds died during the course of the study, including one that was lethally removed for repeatedly depredating least terns at Batiquitos Lagoon, south of the Base. There is some evidence to suggest that birds that had achieved breeding age returned more quickly to the Base and survived longer; the individual that returned the fastest was a bird known to have a nest with eggs at the time of translocation; however our sample size was small and there were no significant differences in return rates or mortality based on species, age, sex, or breeding status. We recommend an approach to “problem raptors” of different species and breeding status based on these initial results. We also recommend that future studies might use satellite or cellular transmitters to compare return rates of raptors translocated the shorter USFWS-recommended distances with the results from this effort. In addition, we also recommend investigating the effect of a short period of captivity after initial capture, to further reduce homing behavior, coupled with translocation",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,,loboroberto (Robert Wolf)

While segments of this herd were known to summer near Carter Mountain and migrate up to 40 miles east to various winter ranges in the Bighorn Basin, specific movement and distribution patterns have never been documented. We worked with state agencies, federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private landowners to equip 128 pronghorn with GPS collars to document seasonal migration and distribution patterns of this important pronghorn herd. Here, we report the findings from a two-year movement study and make available data and tools to inform management and conservation efforts, including roadway mitigation, fence modification (or removal), and identification of seasonal ranges and migration routes.

Migration were recorded during the 2010/11 and the 2011/12 nonbreeding period. The data set comprise: autumn migration: 3 complete tracks, 3 incomplete tracks; nonbreeding residence: 3 birds; spring migration: 1 complete, 1 incomplete track.

The study was originally designed to identify seasonal distribution and migration patterns of mule deer during the early stages of coalbed methane development (Bureau of Land Management 2007). Phase 1 of the study (2005-2006) was followed by Phase 2 (2008-2011), where the same metrics were evaluated during a period of more intensive energy development (Sawyer and Nielson 2011). Information compiled from Phases 1 and 2 provided fine-scale movement and distribution data needed to refine seasonal range maps, delineate migratory corridors and stopover habitat (Sawyer et al. 2009, Sawyer and Kauffman 2011), and document behavioral impacts to migratory mule deer from energy development, including increased rates of movement and reduced stopover use (Sawyer et al. 2013, Wyckoff et al. 2018). The Bureau of Land Management implemented a final Phase 3 of the study (2014-2019) to monitor winter distribution and migratory patterns of mule deer through years where energy development had shifted primarily to production. Here, we summarize findings from Phase 3 and describe how data from all Phases of the Atlantic Rim Mule Deer Study have been used to advance knowledge of mule deer ecology.

Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds’ directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye—both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader–follower relationships are consistently manifested.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,,nagymate (Mate Nagy)

Using new, archival GPS loggers, we tracked individual purple martins (Progne subis) from breeding colonies across North America to determine precise (<10m) locations of migratory and overwintering roost locations in South America and to test hypotheses for fine-scale migratory connectivity and habitat use. We discovered weak migratory connectivity at the roost scale, and extensive, fine-scale mixing of birds in the Amazon from distant (>2000 km) breeding sites, with some individuals sharing the same roosting trees. Despite vast tracts of contiguous forest in this region, birds occupied a much more limited habitat, with most (56%) roosts occurring on small habitat islands that were strongly associated with water. Only 17% of these roosts were in current protected areas. These data reflect a critical advance in our ability to remotely determine precise migratory connectivity and habitat selection across vast spatial scales, enhancing our understanding of population dynamics and enabling more effective conservation of species at risk.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2014-07-15 04:56:00.000,2015-12-15 03:59:00.000,128,Progne subis,GPS,fraserkc (Kevin Fraser)

The possibility of trans-Andes migration for Amazonian breeding birds has largely been discounted given the high geographic barrier posed by the Andean Cordillera and the desert habitat along much of the Pacific Coast. Here we demonstrate a trans-Andes route for Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger cinerascens) breeding on the Manu River (in the lowlands of Manu National Park, Perú), as well as divergent movement patterns both regionally and across the continent. Of eight skimmers tracked with satellite telemetry, three provided data on their outbound migrations, with two crossing the high Peruvian Andes to the Pacific. A third traveled over 1800 km to the southeast before transmissions ended in eastern Paraguay. One of the two trans-Andean migrants demonstrated a full round-trip migration back to its tagging location after traveling down the Pacific Coast from latitude 9° South to latitude 37° S, spending the austral summer in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile. This is the first documentation of a trans-Andes migration observed for any bird breeding in lowland Amazonia. To our knowledge, this research also documents the first example of a tropical-breeding waterbird migrating out of the tropics to spend the non-breeding season in the temperate summer, this being the reverse pattern with respect to seasonality for austral migrants in general.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2014-08-16 06:10:40.000,2015-06-28 22:27:23.000,265,Rynchops niger,"Bird Ring,Argos Doppler Shift",LisaD (Lisa Davenport)

The species, which occurs only in the new World, can be seen as far north as southern Canada and as far south as Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America.  Turkey Vultures also occur on many large and small islands including Vancouver Island, Canada, Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.  Six races or subspecies of Turkey Vultures are recognized by biologists:  including septentrionalis in eastern North America, meridionalis in western North America, aura in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean and Central America, ruficollis in southern Central and northern and central South America, jota in South America and falklandica in southern South America and the Falkland Islands.  The scientific name for Turkey Vulture, Cathartes aura, translates as “breezy cleanser,” most likely a reflection of its soaring and scavenging life style. 

Scientists consider North American populations of Turkey Vultures to be partial migrants, in that northern populations of the species migrate, whereas southern populations, in general, do not.  Eastern North American populations of the species typically migrate no farther south than Florida and Texas.  Western populations travel at least as far as Colombia and Venezuela, and some experts believe that some western birds may travel as far south as Brazil and Argentina.  Millions of migrating Turkey Vultures have been counted annually at migration watch sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama.

As scientists we are interested in learning more about the movement ecology of this extremely successful raptor, which seems to have one of the most flexible of all avian migration systems.  Earlier reports from northern South America suggest that northern migrants, which are larger and more massive than local residents, dominate the latter when they arrive on their wintering grounds in December each year.  The extent to which such dominance affects the breeding schedules and numbers of southern birds remains unknown, as does the extent to which individual migrants visit an over-winter in the same location each year.

In the spring of 2003 Hawk Mountain Sanctuary initiated a long-term study of migration behavior in Turkey Vultures in an effort to learn more about the extent, causes, and consequences of their annual journeys.  To date scientists at the sanctuary and its collaborators have placed tiny radio tags monitored by satellite on 21 Turkey Vultures in an effort to follow their outbound migrations south each autumn and their return migrations north each spring.  Five of the satellite-tracked birds also had a data logger surgically implanted in their body cavities.  The loggers record both core body temperature and heart rate.  Recovering these data loggers allows us to determine fluctuations in both body temperature and heart rate associated with day-night cycles and migration activity.  The Sanctuary and its collaborators also have placed red, yellow, or light blue numbered wing tags on more than one hundred Turkey Vultures in Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.

Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25–43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. .45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-06-29 11:00:00.000,2009-07-05 09:30:00.000,116,"Animalia ",Radio Transmitter,kissling (Daniel Kissling)

Washington, DC 20008",rydert@si.edu,,"Seasonal migrations- the regular annual seasonal movements to specific destinations- are among the most fascinating of biological phenomena. In birds, well over half of temperate breeding species migrate to non-breeding locations in the tropics (Rappole 1995) and the degree to which these populations are linked is termed migratory connectivity (Webster et al. 2002, Marra et al. 2006). The linkages between the breeding and non-breeding season can have profound impacts when events from one season “carry-over” and affect events in another season (Marra et al. 1998). For example, dry non-breeding conditions may reduce food availability influencing departure timing, migratory performance and subsequent reproductive effort (Studds & Marra 2011, McKellar et al. 2013, Reudink et al. 2009). As such, characterizing migratory connectivity and seasonal interactions is essential for understanding complex population dynamics and can contribute to the management and conservation of migratory species (Webster & Marra 2005, Marra et al. 2010). Despite the importance of understanding how populations are linked, studying migratory connectivity and finer scale carry-over effects necessitates tracking individuals throughout the annual cycle across large geographic areas.
                  Technology has rapidly advanced our ability to track animals with higher spatial and temporal resolution (Bridge et al. 2011). Within the last five years alone, we have reduced uncertainty about where birds winter from ~150 km (i.e., light-level geolocators; Ryder et al. 2011) to near pin-point 10m accuracy (i.e., GPS geolocators; Hallworth & Marra 2015). This increased resolution allows researchers to track individuals to the non-breeding grounds and study populations that are truly demographically linked to understand how environmental conditions shape migratory timing, speed, arrival, and breeding reproductive performance. Among migratory birds, short-distance migrants that winter within the southern US and Caribbean are a tractable system to jointly study linked population on both ends of the annual cycle because non-breeding sites are more readily accessible. The Gray catbird (Dumatella carolinensis) is a common short-distance migrant breeding in Washington, DC that winters largely in Florida and Cuba (Ryder et al. 2011). Gray catbird abundance, appropriate body size for current tracking technology, and recognizable song make them a good model system for combining science and education about migration biology at the National Zoological Park.
                  Here, we propose a project that quantifies migratory connectivity and seasonal interactions for Gray catbirds using state-of-the-art tracking technology while concurrently educating the public about the grand phenomenon of migration. The projects overarching scientific and educational objectives are: 1) to characterize the migratory connectivity and locate the non-breeding grounds of gray catbirds breeding within the National Zoological park using GPS geolocators, 2) to examine how non-breeding environmental conditions influence reproductive performance in subsequent breeding seasons, 3) to develop informal educational presentations during live animal tagging and formal curriculum to educate the public about migration, and 4) to use the project experience, outreach, and data as a case study for the development and implementation of the tracking station and more broadly the Experience Migration exhibit.",research,false,true,false,false,False,na,2016-07-01 23:00:06.000,2017-03-27 23:00:10.000,769,Dumetella carolinensis,GPS,evansbr (Brian Evans)

We used a Bayesian state-space model to estimate the most likely breeding locations. All four birds spent the breeding season on the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. These locations spanned approximately 1200 kilometers, and none of the individuals bred in the same location. Speed of migration was nearly twice as fast during spring than fall. The return rate of birds tagged the previous season (33%) was similar to that of control birds (39%), but comparing return rates was complicated because 7 of 11 returning birds had lost their tags.

Using light-level geolocation, we obtained three full annual tracks and one autumn migration track of male red-necked phalaropes caught during breeding in Scandinavia. These tracks confirmed expectations that individuals from the Scandinavian population winter in the Arabian Sea. Migration was accomplished in two to four migration leaps, staging for a few days in the Gulf of Finland (autumn) or the southern Baltic Sea (spring) and for up to a month in or near the Black and Caspian Sea (autumn and spring). In addition, travel speeds suggested that only the flights between the Baltic and Black/Caspian Sea are non-stop, and thus the birds seem to make additional short stops during the other flights. Stopover time in the Black/Caspian Sea is only 8-10 days in spring but up to 36 days in autumn, which is longer than expected if only used for pre-migratory fattening to cover the ca. 2000 km to the Gulf of Oman. After entering the Arabian Sea via the Gulf of Oman, birds dispersed over the entire presumed winter range. Winter movements appear to correspond to the spatio-temporal patterns in primary production linked to seasonally changing monsoon winds. These are not only the first tracks of Scandinavian red-necked phalaropes, but also the first seabird tracks in the Arabian Sea, one of the most productive and dynamic marine areas on the planet.

Uncovering the level of migratory connectivity is crucial for effective conservation actions and for understanding of the evolution of local adaptations and migratory routes. Here we investigate migration patterns in a passerine bird, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, over its wide Western Palearctic breeding range using geolocators from Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Turkey. We found moderate migratory connectivity: a highly significant spatial structure in the connections between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding grounds, but at the same time a partial overlap between individual populations, particularly along the Gulf of Guinea where the majority of birds from the Spanish, Swedish and Czech populations spent their non-breeding period. The post-breeding migration routes were similar in direction and rather parallel for the five populations. Birds from Turkey showed the most distinctive migratory routes and sub-Saharan non-breeding range, with a post-breeding migration to East Africa and, together with birds from Bulgaria, a previously unknown pre-breeding migration over the Arabian Peninsula indicating counter-clockwise loop migration. The distances between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, as well as between first and final sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, differed among populations. Moreover, the total speed of migration did not differ significantly between populations during both the post-breeding migration in autumn as well as during pre-breeding migration in spring. There was also no significant relationship between the total speed of migration and distance between breeding and non-breeding sites (neither post- nor pre-breeding) and, surprisingly, the total speed of migration generally did not differ significantly between post-breeding and pre-breeding migration. Future challenges include understanding whether non-breeding environmental conditions may have influenced the differences in migratory patterns that we observed between populations, and to which extent non-breeding habitat fluctuations and loss may affect population sizes of migrants.",research,false,false,true,false,False,na,2011-07-17 19:43:00.000,2014-05-10 16:09:00.000,10318,,Solar Geolocator,j.kolecek@gmail.com (Jaroslav Koleček)

The composition of the mixed population at a migratory divide and the corresponding non-breeding ranges remain, however, unknown for many Palaearctic-African migrants. Here, we used light-level geolocation to track migration direction and non-breeding grounds of Eurasian reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) from three breeding populations across the species’ migratory divide. Moreover, by using feathers grown at non-breeding grounds, we quantified stable isotope composition for individuals with known southwestern (SW) and southeastern (SE) migration directions. On a larger sample per population, we then assessed the proportions of SW- and SE-migrating phenotypes in each of the three populations. All tracked reed warblers from Germany and two thirds of the birds tagged from the Czech population headed initially SW. Nevertheless, about one third of the birds from the Czech site migrated towards SE. No tracking data have been obtained for the Bulgarian population. The initial migration direction determined by geolocators was a strong predictor of the non-breeding region, with SW migrants staying in West Africa and SE migrants in Central Africa. Feather δ34S and δ15N values confirmed the predominance of SW migrants in the German population, the co-occurrence of SW and SE migrants in the Czech population, and indicated a high (72%) proportion of SE migrants in the Bulgarian population. Thus, the combined approach of geolocator tracking and stable isotopic assignments provided clear evidence for the existence of a migratory divide in the southeast of Central Europe and predicted non-breeding range in Central and Central-Eastern Africa for the eastern population.

Environmental odours have been demonstrated to be critical to homeward navigation in over 40 years of experiments, yet the chemical identity of the odours has remained unknown. In this study, we investigate potential chemical navigational cues by measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs): at the birds’ home-loft; in selected regional forest environments; and from an aircraft at 180 m. The measurements showed clear regional, horizontal and vertical spatial gradients that can form the basis of an olfactory map for marine emissions (dimethyl sulphide, DMS), biogenic compounds (terpenoids) and anthropogenic mixed air (aromatic compounds), and temporal changes consistent with a sea-breeze system. Air masses trajectories are used to examine GPS tracks from released birds, suggesting that local DMS concentrations alter their flight directions in predictable ways.

We found that wingbeat frequency has the strongest positive relationship with ODBA. There was a small, but negative, relationship between airspeed and ODBA, and bats decreased ODBA with increasing tailwind. Bats flew at ground speeds of 9.6 ± 2.4 ms-1 (mean ± sd, range: 4.3 to 23.9 ms-1) and airspeeds of 10.2 ± 2.5 ms-1, and did not modify their wingbeat frequency with speed. Free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats therefore exerted more total ODBA in headwinds but not when they changed their airspeed. It is possible that the flexibility in wingbeat kinematics may make flight of free-ranging bats less costly than currently predicted or alternatively that the combination of ODBA and airspeed at our scales of measurement does not reflect this relationship in straw-colored fruit bats.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2009-08-26 18:09:01.000,2014-12-08 03:00:36.000,17970,Eidolon helvum,"GPS,Acceleration",dina (Dina Dechmann)

Fig. 2. Illustration of presumed diurnal movement on 12–13 September 2015 by male Yellow Warbler
#132, probably across the Yucatan Channel between western Cuba and Mexico/Belize. Note smooth
light transitions on 12 September. The smooth transitions continued onto the morning of 13 September,
suggesting a flight duration of > 24 h. Light transitions are more jagged on days preceding and after the
flight because a foraging bird moves in and out of vegetation, thus affecting light levels recorded by the
geolocator.

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2011-07-10 23:16:00.000,2013-09-18 17:37:19.000,7759,Physeter macrocephalus,GPS,tomasf (Tomas)

Given the migratory tendencies of this species, it is plausible that blue-winged teal may disperse avian pathogens between spatially distant areas. To better understand the potential role of blue-winged teal in the exchange of avian pathogens between North America and areas further south, we collected information on migratory tendencies of this species and sampled birds at spatially distant areas during breeding and non-breeding periods. Forty-two adult, male blue-winged teal were captured and marked. Twelve birds were captured on their summer range in the Saskatchewan and Alberta Canadian Provinces during August 11-15, 2013, with the remaining thirty birds captured at wintering areas along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast in the United States during March 17-22, 2015. We selected only male blue-winged teal weighing ≥380 g for instrumentation. All birds were marked with 9.5 gram, solar-powered Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs) manufactured by Microwave Telemetry, Inc., Columbia, Maryland (USA) and released close to their respective capture locations. The PTTs were attached using a Teflon harness secured over the sternum to have a dorsally extended antenna. The PTTs were programmed with a 10 hour on 48 hour off duty cycle.

The consequences of human-mediated disturbance in natural areas are documented for avian and mammalian species. Less is known about the consequences of human disturbance on reptile species, specifically snakes, residing in natural refuges within the urban matrix. Thus we examined the spatial activity of copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix) in regard to pedestrian trails within an urban forest. We used radio telemetry to track snakes during the active season, and estimated distances moved in between relocations, distances to the nearest trail, and home range size for individuals. We found sex and season, but not distance to the nearest trail, affected the distance snakes moved. In addition, we observed a weak, positive relationship between home range size and average distance to the trail. Sex, season, and body condition did not explain snake distance to the trail, but individual patterns were variable for snakes compared to random locations generated from snake relocations. Our study indicates copperheads may be tolerant of low-level human disturbances found in an urban forest.

However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either “area-restricted searching” (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or “transiting” (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean= 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean= 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale’s return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.",research,false,true,false,true,False,na,2001-03-22 23:48:24.000,2001-09-05 02:55:33.000,513,Balaenoptera physalus,Argos Doppler Shift,tomasf (Tomas)

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species.

In this context we characterise the land occupation strategies of a Western Atlantic French coastal endemic bird: the Bluethroat Cyanecula svecica namnetum. Our study focuses on a key period of the life cycle of this species: the post-breeding moult. Capture and recapture sessions in intertidal habitats have allowed us to retrieve 26% of local breeders during their moulting period. The modeling of moult kinetics revealed that moult of flight feathers takes 37-50 days. A radio-tracking survey of moulting birds revealed exploitation by individuals of both the lowest and tallest vegetal formations of intertidal sites and exploitation of small home ranges (0.42-1.34 ha), typical of locations where trophic resources tend to be abundant and predictable. Analyses of droppings highlighted that Coleoptera, Aranea and marine crustaceans (Amphipoda) contributed most of the prey biomass consumed, amphipods being particularly selected by birds in active moult. Our results underline the importance of intertidal wetlands in terms of trophic opportunities to compensate for the energy costs of moult for the Bluethroat. Given the global changes already dramatically affecting coastal habitats, we emphasise that special attention should be given to the conservation of intertidal wetlands for marshland passerines of conservation concern such as the Bluethroat, and that restoration of adjacent coastal terrain is a promising development.",research,true,false,true,false,False,na,,,,,,Raphael Musseau (Raphael Musseau)
